2,"I've always loved this version of the ancient Arabian tale, Douglas Fairbanks was at the top of his game, lithe and energetic throughout the 148 minutes. There are various copies available, some better than others overall in various states of decomposition, but I haven't seen one better than the Thames Photoplay issue. A copy I've seen (regurgitated by Elstree Hill) has a whole chapter almost burnt up and a teeth-grindingly awful score, so if you're interested it'll probably pay to be careful.  Fairbanks spends the first 20 minutes scene-setting with plenty of stealing and acrobatics, then tries to steal from the Caliph of Bagdad but falls in love with his beautiful daughter instead. He then spends the remainder of the film as the Reformed Thief Of Bagdad, trying to win her. In this he's up against 3 rivals and they're all tasked with finding the greatest treasure to decide which one will marry her. The main role was split into two for the 1940 remake  he was certainly more animated than John Justin! Anna May Wong plays an evil traitor but confidante to the Princess, a role she reprised 10 years later in Chu-Chin-Chow the first film version of which appeared the year before this, and which provided some of the story here too. Some of the special effects still look good especially the flying carpet scenes and creating the million man army, but the rest for the main are primitive  however if you're unfortunate enough to see any of the laughable modern versions, maybe some with eye-splitting digital cartoonery too you'll realise special effects do not make a great movie. This has a great story, great sets, great atmosphere, is constantly inventive within the technological limitations and lives in the imagination long after it's finished. However if comparisons are possible between silent and sound films, I think Korda's version was something extra special and on another level altogether.  So if you care, dig out a good non-budget issue of this for a magical night's entertainment."
2,"This movie was Fantastic with Michael Madsen and Dennis hopper. The story is great,Excellent Action,Great Sex, I without a Doubt Loved this movie Because I love Michael Madsen He is the greatest Actor Ever! Especially In Reservoir Dogs Which I loved! It was Sad to see his character Die. Ed Anders Directing is Superb with Michael Roberts and Charles Durning. I loved the sex scene seeing her wonderful tits and ass. The shootouts were Fantastic with blood and Gore I love violence more than anything If you see this one buy it immediately Whatever the price mine cost $14.95 trust me its worth every penny of your money if you loved this one then you will love Jason goes to Hell which I loved it was fantastic"
2,"Two weeks prior to me writing this user-comment, the legendary Spanish actor, writer, director and reputed sleaze-ball Paul Naschy  a.k.a. Jacinto Molina  passed away from cancer. Even though I disliked and heavily bashed a lot of the films he starred in, including this ""The Werewolf and the Yeti"", I was still a big fan of his work and charismatic appearance and I hope that he'll rest in peace in the hereafter.   Anyway, unlike the cool titles such as ""Blue Eyes of the Broken Doll"", ""A Dragonfly for Each Corpse"" and the more recent and criminally underrated ""Rojo Sangre"", this clearly wasn't the best film to pay a personal little tribute to the departed euro-exploitation star. ""The Werewolf and the Yeti"" is an incoherent and inept mishmash of half- elaborated ideas and generally speaking just a load of rubbish, in fact. What happens if you sent a wolf man out on an expedition to the Himalayas to hunt down the abominable snowman? A very exhilarating and pleasantly deranged exploitation highlight, you'd expect, especially if you also throw in some lurid vampire women in a cave, evil Tibetan smugglers and an ancient myth about Genghis Kahn (*). Wrong! This actually is an infuriatingly boring and imbecilic film. None of Naschy's ""Hombre-Lobo"" flicks I've seen so far are any good, but this is really bottom-of-the-barrel, with unfinished story lines and truly pitiably poor production values. The werewolf transformations are laughable and the special effects deserve a poor zero out of ten rating. It's basically just a series of Naschy's face gradually getting hairier. It even somewhat looks like he's having a severe heart-attack whenever he transforms. Unless I'm mistaken, I also didn't spot any Yetis, Sasquatches, Bigfoots or whatever type of snowy monsters until very late in the film. And even if it does appear, it's very difficult to tell the difference between the werewolf and the yeti. Wasn't the abominable supposed to be snow-white? The dialogs are painfully poor and the even the sleaze footage is likely to put you to sleep. By the way, you know how to recognize a film scripted by Paul Naschy because he always foresees a sequence of him having sex with beautiful woman that would usually never fall for him. Mostly, he even has sex with multiple women at once.   (*) I was quite intoxicated when watching this film, so it's possible that I made some of those story lines up myself. In that case; my apologies."
2,"I`ve rented this film from my local video store under the title ""Shiver"".Until that moment I could never believe that it could exist such a bad movie.All the ingredients of the movie`s recipe are extremelly bad.The actors are playing terribly,the story is ridiculous,the technical part is awful and directing is unexistable.I am sure that I`ve never seen in my life worse movie than this and I am very curious how Philip Yordan ,a brilliant writer had participated in this. As I saw in credits the directors were three.Probably is required a special talent to make a combination of so many bad things.A miracle of bad taste!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"From the first episode, to the last. In my opinion this is the best program to ever grace the television screen.  Its by far the funniest comedy, and certainly the best sci-fi comedy. The Americans try to emulate but fail miserably.  I don't understand the haters of series 7 and 8, there are some fantastic episodes, who doesn't like ace rimmer ? - And Krytie TV is a scream.  The show didn't go down hill from series 6, they just added the gorgeous kochanski, which may not have replaced rimmer but she certainly added something to the show.  I'm in two minds about the film, part of me really wants to see more, but the other part doesn't want to see an ""american-ised"" super special effects film which just isn't red dwarf. It looks like its been cancelled, and the chance of another series has the same odds of me stitching a pair of lemon maternity slacks.  Well it certainly is ""cold outside"" as i type this, so I'll say....  ""Stoke me a klipper, I'll be back for Christmas!"""
0,"Interesting film about an actual event that took place during the Civil War in Vermont. It kept my attention to the end and I don't regret viewing it. I haven't ever read any on this raid incident so I was curious to see if the rebels pulled it off. I enjoy historical films from that era.  My major complaint is with the Confederate uniforms. They look too good!!! The acting was a little stiff at times. I like the old man eating the mashed potatoes because he didn't have any teeth. The wounded soldier playing fetch with a hound was a little strange. Overall, it was a descent film."
2,"Golgo 13 is one of the most interesting anime movies, if you can get past the first half hour. That part of the movie is just to set up that Golgo is the ultimate assassine but the film makers already did that with the first look at Golgo. But once it gets rolling, get ready. It goes full throttle and never lets up. This movie contains one of the coolest shots ever, tracking a bullet Golgo fires through a building. The animation is a mix of hand drawn, comic book frames, and computer animation making it one of the most interesting movies to look at. This is a must see anime, along with Akira and Ninja Scroll. 10/10"
2,"What are accomplished actors like Ellen Burstyn, Peter Boyle, James McDaniel and Deirdre O'Connell doing in this piece of dreck? This is one of the worst-written things I've ever seen - it barely even rises to the level of cookie-cutter formula in its laziness (in the credits, the serial killer character is just called ""The Killer"" - the writer couldn't even be bothered to give him a name, never mind any background). The plot developments are laughable and absurd, the police are made to look completely incompetent, the psychic-ability angle is gratuitous and poorly used, and there is virtually no suspense to speak of. Kristin Davis and Matthew Settle are very attractive-looking leads, but their characters are boring ciphers. Avoid at all costs, especially if you are a fan of any of these actors."
2,"Intensly personal and moving documentary about the life and times of arguably one of the more well known porn stars - Annabel Chong.  The film covers the time during and following her world record of sleeping with 251 men in 10 hours. We see her preparation for the attempt, the attempt itself and the years following where she was afforded great fame but at a huge personal loss.  Annabel is a very intelligent woman; she studied and graduated from USC in 1998 and from her teachers accounts she is a very articulate writer and thinks very analytically. Its only when she tries to verbalise a lot of what she is thinking that we see the pain, the emotional torment that must be facing her every day of her life.  Her voice is one that seems to be on the verge of breaking down into total incomphrensibility - it falters, pauses and staggers along - fuelled a mind that is providing the information but the mouth cannot process it fast enough.  She is a tortured woman; you can see everyone of those 251 men in her eyes every time the conversation moves around to the record breaking feat. She often justifies it by calling it an experiment; one that shows the empowerment of women over men - she was showing that women can be just as agressive sexually as men.  But the price she has paid for it is great. She did not tell her parents for over two years that she was a porn actress. Though not filmed; the after effects of the revelation are shown graphically; her mother on the floor of her room packing Annabels bag, crying and moaning as she removes all trace of her daughter from her life.  There is a lot to this documentary that is worth discovering. Don't get it just for some mindless titalation - there is little of that during its 86 minute running time. What you do get though is a look into the human condition; a condition that craves acceptance amongst peers, a condition that believes it is in control of its own destiny.  A moving lesson for all.  8 out of 10.  "
0,"Thanks for killing the franchise with this turkey, John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace. This movie sucks on so many levels it's pathetic. The first VAMPIRES was fun, but this low budget retread makes me yawn.  Jon Bon Jovi (the poor man's Kevin Bacon) drives around Mexico with a surfboard housing a hidden compartment holding his vampire killing gear ala Antonio Banderas's guitar case in DESPERADO. He picks up some lame ""hunters"" along the way (including an annoyingly feminist infected girl who takes pills to keep from turning into a vampire), and they set out to stop some female master vampire who is given no backstory and so we could care less about her or her quest (to walk in the sunlight by stealing the Black Cross and performing a ritual to allow her to do so). If you've seen the first VAMPIRES, you've already seen this, and done much better.  John Carpenter has been responsible for a lot of bad movies lately. Frankly, I think he's past his prime and incapable of making another horror classic. The only decent film he's done since THEY LIVE (1987) is VAMPIRES. Everything else is complete crap, right up until the unbelievably cheap looking and retarded GHOSTS OF MARS... and now this waste of celluloid. Where are more greats like ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, HALLOWEEN (1), ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK and THE THING?  Carpenter crony Wallace proves he can't write his way out of a paper bag with his paper-thin script packed with yawns, groans and recycled gags from the original. Did I mention I hated every character in the movie? There was not a single memorable character in the whole film. How does that happen? This film has nothing to recommend it. Not even the DVD presentation is good; the menu looks awful.  By comparison, JASON X: ""FRIDAY THE 13th IN SPACE"" was a masterpiece. Now that is how you make a sequel and (re)energize a franchise, ladies and germs, as well as create an exciting DVD menu."
2,"*possible spoilers*  Kevin Smith debut film is brilliant because it works on so many different levels. From budget limitations resulting in running gags -the closed shutters ""explaining"" the darkness on the store setting where in fact they could only shoot at night- to a series of funny customers episodes and even, well ""romantic"" story lines, the movie is based on a great script and works through the acting skills of its cast, especially Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson.   In the end it's not just a great comedy, it actually manages to deliver something that can be called ""a message"", when, after main character Dante has survived possibly the worst day in his life, he has to admit that it wasn't all just bad luck but also a broad hint that he could/should change his life as a clerk."
2,"I had high hopes for this, as I thought the original was very innovative. Here, we get more of ""kind of"" the same, but not always. First, I thought the premise from the first movie was that in order to save yourself, you had to make a copy of the videotape.   ***POSSIBLE SPOILER***  I'll have to go back & review that part, because that wasn't necessarily what was implied in this film.  There were some very good scenes, especially the one involving deer (although I have to say, at one point I was reminded of the deer scene in ""Without a Paddle"", where a deer suddenly seems like he's growling at the actors!). Still, many things just didn't add up.  ***SPOILER***  When Aidan leaves the hospital, that's the last we see of any hospital involvement. They have a sick child missing & a dead doctor, & no one comes to the house looking for him or his mother?! It's like they introduced the hospital scenes solely to have Rachel accused of child abuse, & then they just drop the point.  Also, the whole premise of the first movie was that it was watching the videotape that caused death. Yet, other people die without having seen the movie. If Samara was that powerful, why did she wait so long to come after Rachel & Aiden? I thought Sissy Spacek was great (but then, she usually is), almost unrecognizable in fact. All in all, first half of the movie was very good, lots of tension; it just didn't seem to be able to sustain the plot or the horror. I give it a 4."
1,"I first encountered this show when I was staying in Japan for six months last year. I found it in the internet when I was looking for sub-titled dramas to help me with my Japanese. My host mother warned me to stay away from it because she thought it was weird, but I found it delightful! Koyuki showed such conflicting character traits and Matsujun's spirit made my day every time I tuned in! I first saw him on ""Hana Yori Dango"", but I liked him much better in this!  Although the characters are interesting and well-developed, I was disappointed to find that they didn't change very much throughout the show. Their relationship grew, but they didn't really. Still, a fun time had by all (Even for Fukushima!)."
0,"Writer-director Tony Piccirillo adapted his own play about a straight man, recently widowed, learning in the last three weeks he is HIV-positive; he tracks down the one homosexual partner he ever had, brings him to an apartment and ties him up, forcing a blood test on the guy and promising bloody revenge if the results come back positive. Intriguing idea sounds better on paper than it plays out. James Marsden's captive is realistically cynical and snotty, but the actor's own artificial mannerisms are disconcerting--it's like watching a roadshow version of Tom Cruise. Scott Speedman has to work harder with the more challenging role, but his personality-turn from shy guy to kidnapper-on-the-edge isn't convincing, and neither are the conversations the two men have. Marsden's gay party boy isn't apathetic, of course--he's momentarily sympathetic to Speedman's plight--but he doesn't react or behave the way any homosexual man would in this circumstance. The movie isn't a cop-out, exactly, but it is a fraud, handicapped further by the bad editing, the poorly-conceived flashbacks, the low-budget production, and the big finale which smacks of silly pretension and soapy melodrama. *1/2 from ****"
1,"I was literally preparing to hate this movie, so believe me when I say this film is worth seeing. Overall, the story and gags are contrived, but the film has the charm and finesse to pull them off. That gag where Jason Lee thinks he has crabs, and tries not to let his boss/future father-in-law and co-workers see him scratching himself isn't terribly intelligent, but it sent me into a frenzy of laughter. Very few of the film's gags are high-brow, but they made me laugh. As I said, the film has charm and charm can go a long way.   The characters are likable, too. I must say I wish I got to see more of James Brolin's character, since he was a hoot in the very few scenes he was in. Plus, I admire any romantic comedy that has the guts to not make the character of the wife (who serves as the obstacle in the plot) a total witch. The Selma Blair character is hardly unlikable, and there's never a scene where I thought to myself, ""Why did he want to marry her in the first place?"" The ending is Hollywood-ish, but it could've been much more schmaltzy.   The cast is talented. I haven't had a favorable view of most of Jason Lee's mainstream work. I just loved him so much in Kevin Smith's films that I couldn't help but feel disappointed at seeing him in these dopey roles. And he never looks comfortable in these dopey roles. Even in this movie, he doesn't look perfectly comfortable, but he contributes his own two cents and effectively handles each scene. But I still miss his work in independent films. Julia Stiles proves again why she's so damn likable. Of course, she's a very beautiful girl with a radiant smile that makes me want to faint, but she also possesses a unique charm and seems to have good personality. In other words, her beauty shows inside and out. I don't know the actresses' name, but the woman who plays the drunk granny is hilarious. Julie Hagerty also has a small part, and she's always enjoyable to watch, which makes me wish she received better roles. I loved her so much in ""Airplane"" and ""Lost in America"" that it's a shame she doesn't get the same opportunities to flaunt her skills.   Don't be put off by the horrible trailers and even more horrible box office records. This is a funny, charming film. Romantic comedies are getting so predictable nowadays that it feels like the genre itself is ready to be flushed down the toilet, so it's always to see a good one among all these bad apples.   My score: 7 (out of 10)"
2,"Lana knows her soda jerk job blindfolded and gets a bonus for never being late for work EVER! Big Deal! She's sick and tired of this joint and this crummy small town. She wants to get out and live a little. So, she leaves her job and goes off to New York, giving herself a makeover. But, not before, she got into a big huff with Robert Young, her boss and there's a matter of a ""slight"" misunderstanding. So, Bob goes off looking for her. But she is minding her business in New York, when trouble of another kind falls in her lap. It's more than you bargained for in this fun, non-stop quirky little film, costarring EugenePallette, Walter Brennan, and Dame May Witty. It's the kind of film you just don't want to end. So, forget everything and discover that life can be ""slightly dangerous,"" when you go looking for it."
0,"Made the unfortunate mistake of seeing this film in the Edinburgh film festival. It was well shot from the outset, but that's the last positive comment I have about the film. The acting was awful, I wonder if actual gogo girls were hired? But it was the plot that was truly laughable, in fact that it was laughable and not boring is the only reason I gave this 3/10.  ** Spoilers below **.  I just want to mention a few of the scenes that really got the audience laughing:.  Shoving the girl in the field: who would have thought that a kid shoving another kid could be acted so badly. A real eye-opener.  The getting on the bus scene: the girl is getting on the bus. But, according to the music, the world is ending.  The rolling under the clothes line: Wow, this one really demonstrates the plot writer's skills. In the room, followed by raw meat and skill selling. Why not just get her to perform all three 'sins' at once? At least then the film might have been slightly shorter.  The running down the stairs of the mall: watch as one of the girls takes to flight down the stairs pursued by a flesh eating Dau, no wait .. she *is* just walking quickly trying not to break her nails.  The running covered in blood: this is definitely my favourite scene, and a fitting end to the movie. A half marathon in red paint, completed by vaulting up stairs and over the bridge, only to be sent flying most unrealistically by a passing car. Not only this, but this suicide is undertaken by the most self obsessed girl in the film, now that's sticking to character for you.  I'd like to think that this film was created by a 16 year old and their mates. Sadly, having met the director at the presentation, this is not the case.  But, if you're in a sarcastic mood, and fancy a laugh with a few mates.. then still don't even think about it."
2,"The Alpha Video release seems to be fairly complete with the entire story intact (except for some splicy sections in what was probably a 16mm television print: The story does make sense in this version which has the entire explanation of why the criminals are on the ship in the first place and what the doctor's motivations are.  It is mysterious that the film runs about 63 minutes when the main IMDb description has it released at 57 minutes. That's probably incorrect and doesn't represent the original theatrical release, but rather some random individual's timing from a DVD or VHS tape that wasn't complete in the first place."
0,"There is a reason why this made for British TV movie only appeared at the 1977 Toronto Film Festival. It is dull, plodding and lacking in suspense.  Peter OÕTooleÕs diffident performance and the appearance of playwright Harold Pinter are the only elements of interest.  Note : Some British film fans will enjoy seeing Philip Jackson, best known for his portrayal of Inspector Japp in the Poirot television series, in one of his earliest roles...."
2,"I'm a fan of the gut-wrenching. I like horror & suspense. I like to be shocked. Some of my all-time favorite films I wouldn't dare show my closest of friends out of fear that they would think I was mentally unstable. This film, 'The Girl Next Door', I would choose to not show them simply because it's a bad film. I'm not sure what Greg Wilson tried to accomplish here, and the screenplay was poorly adapted from Ketchum's novel. This is torture-porn, lightly cloaked by a terrible excuse for a love story.  You've got two sisters, Meg & Susan Loughlin who are based on Sylvia & Jenny Likens, who were both horribly abused by one Gertrude Baniszewski - who is portrayed in the film as Ruth Chandler. In the true story of these crimes, the girls are abandoned by their circus traveling parents and left to live with Gertrude. In the film, the girls parents were killed and they end up with the same fate - to live with Ruth. Ruth is abusive and out of her mind and so are her accomplices who happen to also be her own children and some neighborhood kids. So as days pass, both girls are abused and tortured in terrible ways, with the older of the two getting the brunt of it. Ruth uses her basement as her chamber of horrors and calls what she does ""games"", for instance one ""game"" involves hanging & blindfolding Meg by her arms and stripping her nude. The boys take care of this for her, and Meg is left there over night. This type of thing makes up the majority if the second half of the film. Enter the ridiculous premise of one of the boys and Meg having feelings for each other. This is ridiculous because the boy continues to go over to the house time after time watching (and sometimes partaking) in said torturous activities. The police show up a few times. He tells his parents (in a round about way). Point is, the way the movie unfolds, these girls wouldve been saved, numerous times. It's almost laughable how we are supposed to believe none of these morons wouldve done something. What happened in real life is nowhere near what went down on film. The story has so many holes that you could throw it in a cave in France, take it out in a year, then slap a sticker on it ""100% Grade A Swiss Cheese"". It's terribly lame & incredibly unbelievable. I assume this side story of love was added to try and get some emotion from the audience so that the ending of the film could pull some tears out. The acting is plastic & any emotional investment, other than imaging that some form of this film actually happened, is completely impossible to reach. If you want to shock us, take what REALLY happened for once and just show that. Don't waste our time with preposterous side & back stories.  The only reason I didn't give this a 1 is because the last 12 minutes or so were actually intense. The rest of the film, however, is tripe. Skip it.  -iii"
2,"This is a movie that operates on more than one level, most of which is so subtle as to be nearly imperceptible --or at least seems to be imperceptible, dwarfed as everything else is by the manifest opprobrium of the main character.  Superficially what we all clearly see is a dark comedy about a despicable cad, Lenny, who is not just despicable, but despicable with oblivious aplomb, a role played masterfully by Charles Grodin, the aforementioned opprobrious main character and star of the movie. That factoid right there sets up a dynamic wherein people are either going to love this movie or hate this movie, based strictly on how Lenny strikes them. Some find humor in this guy, but others do not. Many are off-put. So off-put, in fact, that they can't get past it. In that way I would compare this 1972 film to a more contemporary one, Sideways (2004). In Sideways the main characters, Jack in particular (played by Thomas Haden Church), were so personally offensive, in word, in thought, and in deed, that many people intensely disliked the movie solely on that basis. People say to me, ""I hated Sideways."" I ask them why and they say, ""I couldn't stand Jack."" Some perspective is called for here. The viewer is supposed to dislike Jack in Sideways. That was intended. Maybe find him a little entertaining --or not-- but disliking him is the intended effect. Likewise here with Lenny in The Heartbreak Kid. We are supposed to dislike Lenny. We can laugh at him too if we want to, and he is funny, but disapproval and repulsion is the intent.  At the very least Lenny's actions make most people just plain awkwardly uncomfortable. The movie thereby evokes certain feelings and emotions in the viewer that aren't often evoked by movies, which, all by itself, makes this movie unique. As a work of art it makes it a success. And that's just the superficiality of it. There's more to it than just that.   Bruce Jay Friedman, the writer, and Neil Simon, the director, were actually making some much deeper ethnic observations and social commentary here. Commentary about Jews, about Jews and Jewish culture in modern America, about Gentiles too, and about how Jews and Gentiles interact in that modern America. All that. But mostly the observations and commentary was about the condition of young Jewish men (some of the very same turf that was being plowed by novelist Philip Roth in about the same era as this movie was released). Lenny, the character played by Grodin, is the almost stereo-typical young angst-filled Jewish male, desperate to break out from the box of tradition which was preordained for him, and who rubbishes his very Jewish bride on their honeymoon to lust after a very Gentile blond, Cybil Shepherd as Kelly Corcoran, all as a part of that angst condition. The Corcoran family, meanwhile, presenting themselves as the cold, aloof uptight WASPs.  Friedman had a lot to say here. Simon executed it well. Probably among Simon's best work, although not ever really recognized as such. A remake with Ben Stiller in the Lenny role is now in the works, soon in the offing. We'll have to see if they improve upon the original. I have my doubts that they can even come close. While not perfect, the original is a good movie. But perhaps the time for this story has passed. It was relevant, pertinent, and apropos for 1972. Not so sure about that in 2007. Not to disparage Ben Stiller, but the underlying themes of this movie wouldn't mean as much today as it did 35 years ago.  Grodin and Shepherd give good performances. Eddie Albert did too. I heard Cybil say in an interview not all that long ago that she always wished they'd done a sequel to it, and that she was still open to the possibility.   Very much worth seeing before one sees any remaking of it."
2,"When I saw this on Cable I presumed it was from the 1960s. The animation is a bit fuzzy, and the colors and the effects really look like 1960s animation. Surprised to discover that this animated movie was from 1994! Dom DeLuise does an excellent job as the main character of Stanley, the friendly troll. The other characters are done well, and a Troll in Central Park is a nice movie, but it is very boring for children who are older than 5 or 6. There are some standard plot elements and moments of discovery.The animation for the little girl is also very good. She is amazingly sweet and innocent If anything, ATICP is too sweet and it lacks any snap or sizzle. This film is like a big gob of melted marshmallows."
1,"What i like about you is one of those series you need to see but aren't sure you would see, the beginning is cool and its sucks you into the series just for fun, the second part i season 2-3 which are more stale, they come and go in what you want. what happens with many series is that they don't end with something special because the second part of the series always goes down into the drain, this one also somewhat did, the third part is the one to spoil and ruin the whole series, usually, but it doesn't, this ending is perfect for the series, it fits perfect, actually i was pretty angry about all these guys in Val's life, actually i wanted to end with Jeff in the end, but later on it changed, they chose to take Vic into the series after almost 3 seasons without him, and that was the biggest surprise and also what made the series go on top.  see it many times the series is actually very cool just don't expect the second part to be that good it isn't but the third part does what was needed and made the series to one that was worth the whole thing, i am happy to say i was glad and happy about the series and now i will go over to see two guys a girl and a pizza place, when i have seen the whole series i will be back..."
0,"What has Ireland ever done to film distributers that they seek to represent the country in such a pejorative way? This movie begins like a primer for film students on Irish cinematic cliches: unctuous priests, spitting before handshakes, town square cattle marts, cycling by country meadows to the backdrop of anodyne folk music. Quickly, however, it becomes apparent that the main theme of the film is the big Daddy-O of Irish Cliches - religous strife. It concerns a protestant woman who wants to decide where her Catholic-fathered child is educated, which would seem like a reasonable enough wish, though not to the '50's County Wexford villagers she has to live with. Rather than send them to a Catholic school, she decides to up and leave for Belfast, then Scotland, where a few more cliches are reguritated. While she's there, her father (who looks eerily like George Lucas) and family back home are subjected to a boycott, which turns very nasty. I'm not going to give away the ending, not because I think people should go see this movie, but because it's not very interesting. One of the problems with the film is the central character: we're supposed to sympathise with her but end up instead urging her to get a life. The villagers are presented as bigots whose prejudices should be stood up to, but traumatising your kids seems an innappropriate way to go about it. In addition, it takes on burdens which it staggers igniminiously under when it tries to draw analogies with the current Northern Ireland peace process: the woman is told by her lawyer that she ""must lay down preconditions"" for her return. The film is allegedly based on a true story but it's themes have been dealt with much more imaginatively, and with less recourse to hackneyed cliches, in the past."
2,"As directed masterfully by Clint Eastwood, ""Flags of Our Fathers"" plays both as a war film and a sensitive human drama. It begs comparison with Orson Welles' screen masterpiece ""Citizen Kane"" in the film's scope and its structure.  The ""rosebud"" of ""Flags of Our Fathers"" is one of the greatest icons of American history: the photograph of the raising of the flag on the tiny island of Iwo Jima and the strategic importance of the bloody combat for the acquisition of a landing strip to nearby Japan for American planes. The questions that the film carefully traces are (1) Who were the Marines pictured in the famous photograph? and (2) Was this famous tableau a ""staged"" scene, as opposed to a real event?  To answer these questions, the film moves episodically among three time-frames--the horrifying battle for the hill at the western tip of Iwo Jima; the time in which three servicemen are identified as the heroes in the picture and paraded ceremonially around America to promote the sale of war bonds; and the time of the death of John ""Doc"" Bradley, one of the alleged Iwo Jima flag-raisers, as his son seeks to learn the hidden truth about his dad, much like the newspaper reporter on the trail of ""rosebud"" in ""Citizen Kane.""  The outstanding pacing of the film by Eastwood is matched by the creative cinematography and the work of designers who accomplish these extraordinary tasks: the recreation of the Iwo Jima theater of war with location filming; a spectacular amphibious landing; grisly scenes of combat....plus detailed period scenes on the home-front. As a minor spoiler alert: please be sure to stay through the film's closing credits for a thoughtful montage of still photographs of the Battle of Iwo Jima, as well as the three protagonists, Bradley, Gagnon, and Hayes.  Among the fine ensemble cast, it is impossible to forget Adam Beach's sensitive and heartbreaking performance as Ira Hayes, a Native American who is simultaneously made into a war hero and marginalized due to his race. Hayes never felt comfortable in claiming status as a hero for his involvement in the flag-raising. In an emotionally-wrenching scene in a hotel room before a military superior, Beach's character breaks down and poignantly expresses the camaraderie and love felt for the fallen members of his battalion. Indeed for all three of the purported flag-raisers, the true heroes were those veterans who sacrificed their lives so that the flag could be raised on Iwo Jima. For this moving and important message, ""Flags of Our Fathers"" deserves to be placed not only among the greatest war films of all time, but also alongside classics like ""Citizen Kane."""
2,"The Matriarch (1995) is a pretty boring horror movie it has to be said!! Granny (Stella Stevens) gets a visit from a strange man who gives her this potion that he claims will give her eternal life, while this is going on Granny's Granddaughter Kelly (Shannon Whirry) is preparing dinner for all Granny's nasty, greedy, money seeking relatives.  All these nasty relatives want Granny dead and want all her money and fortune, after the dinner, granny decides to drink the potion but it ends up killing her...... temporarily!!! She then returns as some zombie type creature, killing off all the horrible relatives one by one, it ends up with a good vs evil battle, with granny having a climatic battle with her nice innocent granddaughter Kelly.  The Matriarch is quite a boring horror, there's blood and killings but not really any good gore and the film drags on, i give the movie 3/10 but thats only coz i like Stella Stevens and Shannon Whirry!"
2,"I believe this to be the worse movie I've seen in a long time! I can't speak for others out there who enjoy low budget movies but I do NOT. If you don't crack up when someone says something totally pointless or if you just don't like worthless humor then you'd do best in staying away from this movie. In this movie you'll see situations when they ""want"" you to laugh. But you simply won't. You'll only end up getting annoyed. I Rate this move 1 of 10. Awful is the word!  Don't waste your time, money or anything at all on this piece of ""film"". It is not worth it. You'll only get disappointed and angry that you wasted those 2hours on this.  Why would you want to waste anything on this movie when there are so many other, MUCH better, movies out there?"
2,"I first saw this movie visiting my uncle in Florida for the summer when I was 10 years old. I'm sure I watched a fair number of TV shows and movies that summer. I remember none of the shows or movies - save this one. Unfortunately, I saw this and have remembered it these nearly 30 years - but only because it was so God awful.  It started out weird enough and got my attention. A lady develops a tumor like bulge on her neck, a shrink's patients start freaking out, surgeons and doctors can't treat the woman but it just got weirder and weirder while the actors tried to keep a straight face. Over the top acting, bad special affects and a bizarre plot that just not translate to the screen make this watchable only if you also enjoy seeing car wrecks.  The finale was pure 1970's cheesy special effects that make the old Star Trek sets look high brow in comparison. I have been haunted by this horrible piece of film making for most of my life and fear that the memories will remain with me forever. If you have not yet experienced the crappiness that is the Manitou - save yourself - and rent anything else."
1,A beautiful postcard of New York. The thing I enjoyed most was being able to watch this with my whole family and not cringe waiting for a stupid toilet humor joke to appear. It never did. My teenagers liked it too. My son for Natasha Henstridge and my daughter for Michael Vartan. My wife and I commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and ALL enjoy something. This film told a story that felt comfortable but not old or done. The ending came with a twist which we all liked too. If you are not just a cynical person and have are willing to let a story unfold then this is for you. As a guy it takes a lot to hold my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this one did. I recommend it and we need more of these films to watch.
0,"I enjoy quality crapness, and this ranks up there with some of the finest. the cg is out of this world, or at least pre-dates our world, and the insanity of a 6 foot bloke in a rat outfit chasing after people is laughably bad. I quite enjoyed some of this, but the acting is so goddamn awful, and even the obligatory nude scene doesn't really have any baps out in it. just a complete waste of time if ever i saw one. I don't know who wasted more time, me watching this, or the poor saps who got dragged into making it in the faint hope that this will launch their acting careers. I can assure you, it wont. However, on a brighter note, I have managed to successfully do the 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon from this movie, so I think it was almost worthwhile watching the 91 minutes of it."
2,"After the promising first minutes of the movie which look like they where trying to build a serious profile behind the killings, the movie drifts to a simple and disgusting presentation of violence.  A movie made for perverts...  The acting is decent, the storyline is not. The entire plot focused on the student trying to understand the psyche of the killer is only based loosely on the facts, all leading to build up more shots with violence. Even so it may have happened that way - why would you make a movie that features the most disgusting things a human has done? Looked to me like the director and writer failed to find a clear statement for the film and therefore went down the easy way by producing a flick that thrives on pain and the scandal behind it to get recognition at the box office."
2,"To this films' credit, I did manage to sit through the whole thing - and there are a couple of interesting ""ideas"" (discussed more lucidly on the back cover of the video than onscreen) The main problem though is that the acting, suspense, and production values are no better than those of a ""Brady Bunch"" episode - or any other TV show of that vintage. There were ""Stun Gun"" shoot-outs (Star Trek?), unbelievable resolutions to events, holes in the plot, and questions left unanswered like: ""Why were the girls being killed?"" It was watchable but  by no means a great movie: ""It's the story, of a plastic surgeon, who gave face lifts to some very lovely girls ....."""
0,"Tom is listening to one of those old-time radio broadcasts, something kids from the 1950s to today would watch on TV. However, they didn't television when this cartoon was made so people got their entertainment - from comedies to music to scary stories - from the radio.   Tom is literally shaking in his boots listening to some story about the ""phantom."" He's actually literally doing everything the narrator is saying, such as ""hair standing on end, icy chills race down her spine, her heart beats in her throat,"" etc. Jerry, meanwhile, is watching Tom and laughing his butt off at his scaredy- cat antics.  We then get a taste of what we will see for many years after this 194- cartoon in which Jerry tortures Tom for no reason other than sadistic pleasure. If the cat asks for trouble, that's one thing, but when he's minding own business and Jerry is physically (and in this case, mentally) abusing him, I have a hard time rooting for the ""little guy.""  These early T&M efforts also were a minute longer than all that followed. Sometimes that one minute makes a difference. It did here as this actually dragged for awhile. It could have been cut to five minutes without missing anything because the sketches went on too long. That's usual for Tom and Jerry's. Usually, they are much faster-paced."
2,"Despite his occasional appearance in the films of major directors like Max Ophuls, Jacques Becker and Jean Renoir, from the 1950s onwards Jean Gabin seemed content to rely simply on his effortlessly charismatic screen persona and elevate an apparently interminable succession of old-fashioned potboilers which, while undeniably enjoyable in themselves, now seem like a regrettable waste of this monumental French film star. Nevertheless, I try not to miss any of his films when they crop up on Italian or French Cable TV channels and, for what it's worth, I've always been on the look-out for at least two of his late 50s films - Claude Autant-Lara's LOVE IS MY PROFESSION (1958; with Brigitte Bardot) and the film under review here.  Anyway, Gabin is perfectly cast as the world-weary Police Inspector who is pondering retirement when the re-emergence of an old nemesis - a serial-killer who stabs lonely brunettes coming home late at night - taunts him back into action with a supremely clever plan to trap the killer, hence the film's title. The film also features in a supporting role the actor who, for all intents and purposes, replaced Gabin in French filmgoers' minds as the brooding action hero, Lino Ventura, but it's Annie Girardot (as a neglected but ultimately self-sacrificing wife) and Jean Desailly (as her impotent, mother-fixated artist husband) who leave the best impression in the crowded supporting cast.  Jean Gabin would go on to appear as Inspector Maigret in 2 subsequent films - MAIGRET ET L' AFFAIRE SAINT-FIACRE (1959; which I've caught up with a couple of years ago) and MAIGRET VOIS ROUGE (1963) - and work a further 5 times with director Delannoy (including the afore-mentioned second Maigret film); interestingly enough, Delannoy himself would abandon his own artistic aspirations shown earlier in two major French films of the 1940s - L'ETERNEL RETOUR (1943) and LA SYMPHONIE PASTORALE (1946) - to concentrate on modest genre offerings (of which MAIGRET SETS A TRAP is the best-known and probably best overall as well) for the rest of his career.  Inspector Maigret is celebrated French pulp writer Georges Simenon's most famous literary creation and had previously been portrayed on the screen by Pierre Renoir in one of his brother Jean's most elusive films, NIGHT AT THE CROSSROADS (1932), and also by the great Charles Laughton in Burgess Meredith's intriguing directorial outing, THE MAN IN THE EIFFEL TOWER (1950) - neither of which I've watched alas - and would go on to be impersonated by a variety of formidable character actors among them Rupert Davies, Gino Cervi and Michael Gambon for TV!"
1,"THE JIST: See something else.  This film was highly rated by Gene Siskel, but after watching it I can't figure out why. The film is definitely original and different. It even has interesting dialogue at times, some cool moments, and a creepy ""noir"" feel. But it just isn't entertaining. It also doesn't make a whole lot of sense, in plot but especially in character motivations. I don't know anyone that behaves like these characters do.  This is a difficult movie to take on -- I suggest you don't accept the challenge."
1,"All of the people reviewing this film, and probably many professional film reviewers, just don't get it. This film was made with matting sequences and art techniques quite like the works of the great Czech filmmaker, Karel Zeman. If you want to know what I'm talking about, I suggest you get any of Zeman's films, such as The Fabulous World of Jules Verne, Baron Munchausen, Journey to the Beginning of Time, or On The Comet. If you are unable to locate a film, then read the reviews in AMG. They will explain the processes used. If one were to look at Zeman's work and try to compare it to any of the other sci/fi fantasy films of the time, viewers probably wouldn't have gotten it then either. It is unfair to compare either of these filmmakers' styles to the standard technologies of the day, because both Zemen and Hines ""do not compute"". They have a style that is unique to them and should be judged for their creativity only. If you look at this film from a perspective where you KNOW that he intentionally tried to create a pastiche collage of mattes mixed with live action, you could easily come to the conclusion that he did a masterful job. It isn't easy making a bunch of computer cutouts flow. I thought that the creatures were also quite good, also considering how they were made. Hines took a great gamble, and I think his film will not be fairly judged for years to come. Someone promoting the film should have tipped the audience off as to what they would be seeing, rather than let them blindly go into the theater expecting the usual CG work. Regarding the actors, I think Hines also took a page from Zemen's book, in that many of Zemen's actors were somewhat expressionless at first, but became much more engaging as the film and action went on. It is totally refreshing to me to have this movie in my library. I will watch it for years to come, all three great hours of it."
2,"A detective (Panos Thanassoulis) arrives at an isolated villa looking for a missing girl, Laura, and is imprisoned and sexually tortured by a mother/daughter (Meredyth Herold, Michele Valley) duo who have killed Laura, among others, and buried them in their backyard.  This thoroughly bizarre film contains obvious homages to the great film noir, Laura (1944), from the initial plot (a detective in love with a dead girl, whose painting is on the wall) to the beautiful black and white cinematography, to the detective's voice over narration but moves off into directions that are totally unexpected if not downright silly (for example another homage, this time to The Mummy (1932) where one of the main characters is being sodomised by her father who's dressed as the mummy).  Although there's much nastiness and depravity on show (from Thanassoulis being tied down and given electro-shock treatments before Herold urinates on his face, to Valley raping him and then vomiting on his face, to the denouement where Thanassoulis kills Valley with a knife he has strapped on like a dildo), the film never really feels nasty and sick. This is obviously quite incredible and an achievement in itself. How does it pull it off? Well there's a very playful air about the proceedings (some even call this a comedy); Valley and Herold's relationship is almost child like and Valley often speaks to the camera (which is an irritation) in her sweet, pleasant voice discussing what has happened. The whole situation is like a game, albeit fetishistic and depraved games, which, in spite of the fact that we know they're killers, doesn't create any real sense of danger or dread. Interestingly Thanassoulis never really speaks to the ladies, they speak predominantly in English and a little French whilst all we hear from him is the voice over (another common noir technique that the films employs), which is in Greek. Is he consigned to a dreadful fate or does he also not really feel in any real danger? The latter is unlikely but he never really tries to turn the tables on his captors. A truly bizarre film, well made and shot, with excellent and appropriate music in the style of 40s noir. Obviously not for all tastes but certainly worth a look for viewers of challenging and offbeat cinema."
1,"Every once in a while the conversation will turn to ""favorite movies."" I'll mention Titanic, and at least a couple people will snicker. I pay them no mind because I know that five years ago, these same people were moved to tears by that very movie. And they're too embarrassed now to admit it.  I just rewatched Titanic for the first time in a long time. Expecting to simply enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years. I cried again.... in all the same places. It brought me back to 1997 when I can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time. A movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie I can recall (yes, even more than Star Wars). And today, many people won't even admit they enjoyed it. Folks, let's get something straight -- you don't look cool when you badmouth this film. You look like an out of touch cynic.  No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults. Some of the dialogue falls flat, and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly. However, none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film.  Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation. Wait 'til you see him in Gangs of New York before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this film. The movie really was hers, and she held it together beautifully.  James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic. The sinking scenes were horrific, just as they were that night. How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me. I was utterly transfixed.  This film is one memorable scene after another. Titanic leaving port in Southampton. Rose and Jack at the bow, ""flying"". ""Iceberg, right ahead!"" The screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean. The screams of the doomed after she went down. And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears.  The music, which has also been a victim of the film's success, was a key ingredient. James Horner's score was simply perfect. And the love theme was beautiful and tragic. Too bad Celine Dion's pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many.  I confess, I am a Titanic buff. As such, I relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it -- in all its beauty. Perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because I've had such an interest in the ship all my life. However, I doubt many of those I saw crying were Titanic buffs. I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy. The film was made with such humanity.  Another reviewer said it better than I ever could: Open up your hearts to Titanic, and you will not be disappointed."
2,"man, once again aliens want to destroy the earth ... have i mentioned how i hate this stereotype? they always travel huge distances to destroy us or our planet - we must be important ;)   this time they are doing it out of some silly ethical reasons - we are destroying the earth, so they will do it first - no comment so here some logical mistakes: - they take samples of the flora and fauna of the planet - does it mean the nano bugs will destroy everything? even the flora and fauna? if so - why can't they take the samples and let the earth be? if not - why do they need the samples? how far is their genetic engineering and their planet creation/rebuilding skill? nano bugs eating pollution for example? or creating more of endangered species, so they are not endangered anymore?   - from an ethical point of view the aliens are behaving quite unintelligent too - they have no responsibility whatsoever for either us, our planed or the life on it. they could provide us with better technology so we don't destroy the earth and can live in space if they feel some responsibility ... but this wouldn't be such an ""dramatic"" movie, would it.  - sending an ambassador out of the ship when it is surrounded by military is not intelligent at all, especially when he is not invincible. why isn't he wearing a nano-bug-armor? they have knowledge of the human body, but just didn't care to understand how we are thinking? - the ambassador initially wants to get to the UN, so they have studied us a bit after all (never mind not understanding our concept of military). but they seemingly have no idea that the UN is quite powerless - they should have attended one of the G8 summits instead. or summoned the big industry guys ... and why is it the ambassador has always to go to the USA - there is a UN headquarter in Vienna.  - the idea of sending an ambassador vs sending their message on all TV channels and thus reaching all people without even landing and causing this panic ... what do you thing is better?   some other points:   - they have studied us for a while, decided to destroy us and suddenly change their mind because of what? i really couldn't understand why they would stop? do they believe we will change? do you? i think not without the giving us some technology.  - the alien ambassador just looks at some formulas on a black board and knows what it is and why it is wrong ... i study informatics and have a lot of math - you just can't know all the formulas and even if you do you won't always recognize them, since there are different ways to say the same.  so - bad script, the acting disappointed me too - no point in watching this one."
2,"Nowadays it is not so easy to find a film that hits directly your heart and sentiments. Benito Zambrano gives an opportunity to recover all those sentiments that are well hidden in your subconscious.  Carmona is a small town too close to Seville to have a real identity and is the frame for a difficult and impossible relationship between a daughter, mother and father. Zambrano shows how difficult is to grow up in this outcast and bit farmer town with the leit-motiv of these three characters that join back together due to the father's illness. The father is marked rude and impolite, used to hit the wife or the daughter to show his total dominance and authority. The wife was totally subjected to this situation and the opportunity to find some understanding and heat with their neighbour is accepted with detachment by her. This side relationship with a lonely man brings back love to this sad and destroyed family. The daughter is even worse, alcoholic and in love with a truck driver who does not care of her pregnancy.  The loneliness of the void with a breach of optimism is well expressed in this simple but very effective and straight film.  Rating: 7/10"
2,"My son LOVES this film. I've also given it to nephews and the children of friends. It's geared to kids in the age range of 4-8 and not adults - although I thought it was cute the first time I watched. However, my son watches it over and over and knows all the words by heart so it's great for hours of video ""babysitting."" The idea of going inside his TV and having an adventure particularly seems to appeal to him. There's also a nice moral at the end about little brothers and sisters."
2,"P. a. i. n. f. u. l.  Absurd, insultingly banal sex farce that attempts to make some obvious statement about reformed gays but the screenwriters and director are too superficial to accomplish this simple a task. The film is chock full of character with names like ""Marc's Trick,"" ""Hot Shirtless Guy"" and ""Hot Clothed Guy"" - I'd rather receive a hot glue enema than sit through this a second time, but this film does raise so many questions: Why do people see movies like this when there are so many quality films out right now? After watching this, do people immediately rush home to take a shower? Will any of these actors ever work again? What can we, as a civilization, do to stop Phillip J. Bartell from directing another film?"
2,"I just finished watching this movie with my friends, and I am actually angry right now. I want to punch myself in the face because this movie was so incredibly horrible. I want my hour and a half back. Please, never see this movie. I do not understand how the actors of this movie could allow this to be released. They are successful actors, but this movie makes them all look money hungry and that they do not care about stealing time and money from the viewer. I hope I have saved someone the time. ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE! The plot is horrible, the acting is cheesy, and the jokes are not even original. You sit there in a stupor waiting for it to get entertaining, but it never does. I am ashamed of the actors/comedians for making this. The only real joke is the one that the producers/writers/actors played on the unsuspecting viewer!"
2,"A voiceover accompanies and describes celebrated writer and hunter Alex MacGregor (Donald Pleasence) while he and his attendants plod through a Thai jungle during this film's opening scene, as they search for a deadly rogue black leopard that has killed numerous local villagers. Alex is attacked and savaged by the animal, and made permanently lame as a consequence, and his offer of a ten thousand dollar reward for the beast if captured unharmed is soon claimed by successful Siamese beaters, following which the hunter keeps the caged mankiller at his remote palatial home while preparing for a rematch. The purpose of this revived hunt will be for MacGregor to expunge a newly found emotion within him: fear (although his high-powered scoped rifle should be of no little assistance in that regard), and after giving his servants two weeks off with pay, loads his weapon with nine rounds (for the fabled number of lives), frees the creature and limps off alone in pursuit of it. This is an interesting notion for what promises to be a stirring tale of adventure, but then the plot shifts to Bangkok, where are found the two daughters of Alex, Leslie (Nancy Kwan) and Georgia (Jennifer Rhodes with the work's best performance), along with the latter's child, all about to embark upon a journey to pay their father a surprise call. The three females are escorted by a transplanted Texan, a tour guide in the Thai capital and a former lover of Georgia, and he becomes romantically embroiled with her sister immediately after the group's arrival at the vacated MacGregor estate, while the title character is only seen as he threatens the visitors, the big game hunter seemingly having been swallowed by the encroaching flora as he seeks his hardly elusive prey. The matter of Axel's struggle with fear becomes subordinate to his offspring's emotional entanglements, although there are many slow motion closeups of the brute to enliven the action in a film that is bedevilled with serious flaws of continuity."
2,"When the comedy channel comes out with content like this, it makes me wonder why the Canadian government forces channels to have Canadian content. Because that is the only explanation as to why this show ever existed... As filler to appease the law so the Comedy channel would have ""Canadian"" shows on.  Frankly the writers are probably the worst in the history of television. If I could send them an open letter, it would beg them to retire immediately and move to Slovenia where the locals might find their off-topic humour funny.  The case is even worse too. Elvira Kurt is painful as the host, standing there saying line one liners and praying for the audience to laugh. She should never return to television in any way shape or form. In fact, she should be the one paddling the boat of writers to Slovenia. The rest of the case should swim alongside it, because they don't even deserve a seat in the boat.  Bad, no name guests, bad questions, bad casting, bad writing. You'd have to live in a box to have let this show run for more than one season, or you really really hate your viewers. Your pick.  If there is divine justice, god will strike down this show."
2,"(mild spoilers)  I had heard that this was a ""tearjerker,"" but i was completely taken in by the simple story and the incredible relationship between Dink and The Champ.  I spent the last half of the movie with tears rolling down my cheeks, and i was really struck by a lot of the little details that made the film play much better than a lot of movies nowadays. (And i am not saying that all movies today are bad, hey, i liked the Matrix and Lord of the Rings like everybody else.) But there are little moments, such as the way they hold hands walking out of the gambling joint, or the way Beery takes off his son's shoes and gets him ready for bed, then sits up and looks out the window in despair over having lost everything at the craps table. Just blew me away.   The scene in the jail DESTROYED me, as did the final scene. Just such amazing characters, and you couldn't help but feel for them. Beery is such a terrific on screen presence , and Cooper was just a joy to watch.   HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
1,"As a Westerner watching another culture's view and tradition of marriag, I found Just Married mesmerizing and delightful. The idea of marrying a stranger through the mutual arrangement of parents is difficult, especially in this modern age. Yet this is the case in this Hindi film. Told with humor, and fresh perspective, we learn of Abhay and Ritika who have only met once and are now on their traditional five day honeymoon. As said, it is difficult to believe in this cell phone affluent age that such an archaic custom as an arranged marriage still take place. We see the awkwardness that this young couple feels as they come together on their first night, and how they try to forge a bond, even though they do not know one another. We see different views of marriage and commitment as presented by the other couples also on holiday, from a couple of forty years married to others still unsure of making marital commitment. There's song, witty dialog, poignant moments, blending and comparison of new ways and tradition. Watching the movie with subtitles definitely loses some of the trueness of the story, yet it is still a delight to watch. Granted some of the plot is a little trite and the bus incident a bit drawn out and contrived; however the overall movie was worth watching."
2,"Reading the back of the case I thought this movie might be a good choice to watch. That, however, was a huge mistake. This movie had horrible acting, what must have been an insanely low budget, and the directing was quite poor. I'm sure such directors as Alex Proyas, or others would agree with me on this. Now I am a fan of independent films, but this one was just horrible all around. Another bad feature was how they chose to tell the story. The majority of the film was done by narration. In this type of genre that does not make for a good movie. It often caused the film to seem as if it were dragging along. Another part I had noticed was that they often tried elaborating on certain aspects, like ""key capture"" software, and the writer/directors knowledge on lock picking. It all made it seem very hokey, and not thought out."
2,"It is one thing for a film to merely be bad, it is quite another for it to insult your intelligence. The latter happened to me in this non-attempt at filmmaking. How the likes of Stephen Dorff and Reese Witherspoon (one of my all time favorite actresses) got messed up in this I'll never know, but I hope they fired their managers afterward. This is, quite possibly, the single worst movie I have ever seen (Roger Ebert agrees!). Every character seems to be a ripoff of some celebrity who probably had the common sense to steer clear of this movie. Every situation seems entirely implausible. What's more, the writer seems to have a vocabulary that extends to only the three words in the title (you figure it out). This was a painful movie to watch, not because of it's depth, but because it is so inexcusably horrible. It may be the first time in my life that I actually felt sorry for the actors, who really were at the mercy of this doomed screenplay. I so not buy for one minute the notion that this movie may simply have been ""too deep"" to appreciate. Please, I do not need to be insulted again. Reese, I still think you are on top of your game, and this was ten years ago during your indie phase, so I don't hold you accountable, just please don't let it happen again."

1,"Emma is a horribly flawed film based on Jane Austens classic novel. I have not read the book so I really didn't know that much about the plot, and yet I still predicted nearly the entire plot. There were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing. The film is though for some reason very entertaining and I loved it. Of course there were all the scenes I disliked but the majority was well acted and funny. Gwyneth Paltrow gives one of her best performances as the heroine in Emma. The film also stars Toni Collette(Who has okay but has been much better) Ewan Mecgreger(Who has also been better but he is still very good here) Alan Cumming(Who I have never really been impressed with and is pretty much the same here) and Jeremy Northam(Who's performance is rather wooden at first look but actually fairly subtle, even if that was not what it needed) There have been much better adaptations of Jane Austen books but this one is still very entertaining and worth watching."
2,"**Spoilers**  I saw this movie yesterday, I don't really know much about Rob Zombie, I don't listen to his kind of music. I'm not a big splatter fan, but I did like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and other horror films, so I thought I would give this one a chance.  I actually liked it at first, it was kind of scary and bizarre enough, but it just became more and more sickening, the evil family in this movie was just absolutely disgusting, which wouldn't have been so bad, but they are almost treated as the heroes of the movie, I get the feeling that Rob Zombie doesn't find their behavior all that reprehensible.  One thing that happened was just to ridiculous, there were 5 local cheerleaders that went missing that keep getting mentioned in the movie, and when one is discovered in the trunk of a car, dead, with the words ""trick or treat"" carved into her, they send 2 cops to check things out. That place would have been crawling with cops, my suspension of disbelief doesn't go that far.  I don't mind downbeat endings, sometimes I find them preferable, but this ending just took the cake, I think mostly because it wasn't presented as a downbeat ending, again, I get the feeling that RZ views this as a happy ending. Also, if they were going to end it that way, couldn't at least one of the villains have gotten their comeuppance? I would have loved to see that evil, annoying (but very pretty), blond bimbo get whacked. But of course, I think the director saw them as the heroes of the movie.  I felt dirty after watching this movie."
2,"*********** ********************** ********************  Guys, this movie sucks! I wasted my 1 hour and 30 mints to watching this crap and I was thinking why people makes this type of movie? Then how can they made some great movies too?? Well, the title and ""Genere"" made me interested about it, so I watched...well, if you guys want to waste your 12$ money and 120mints from your life then please watch it! Nothing to say more, only typing now to complete my 10 lines quota. Well, do something good, better watch some porn than this crap.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"
2,"This is a good war film, unusual in that we never get to see the enemy. The cast is small but effective. A couple of minor points grated a little - as Marlonius has already mentioned, Peck really should have picked up Blore's hat for his heroic trek with the injured navigator; early on in the film it was made clear to us how extremely hot the climate was, with the men's tunics soaked in sweat. And after the crash Peck quickly sprouted some impressive bristles, which then all but disappeared.  SPOILER: We saw Peck realising he had found water, then there was an immediate switch back to the airfield where the CO explained what happened next.It was almost as if the makers of the film had realised they were running out of time or money and decided to omit a few scenes.  But all in all this is a convincing production that merits a highish ranking among war films (say in the second quartile)."
2,"Well this movie is nothing special, I laugh at anyone who says it's the greatest crime drama ever, it's not, it's not even at the same level as ""Heat"", it's typical offensive Blaxploitation.  That about sums up the movie, except not as well known and not as effective as ""Heat"", Anthony Quinn and Yaphette are mirror images of Sidney Poitier's character and Rod Steiger. Pretty standard blaxplotation.   Quinn basically plays a racist police named Capt. Mattelli whose about as racist as they come beating up any black person in his path, unfortunately no one in this film gives him an equal amount of beatings.  Kotto as Lt. Pope who is working the case with him involving stolen loot of the mafia from a couple of black criminals.   Man all the characters in the movie are truly revolting black and white. Mattelli isn't the only racist cop, and in fact he's a hypocrite racist who is taking money from a black mafia kingpin!!!!! Truly hilarious.  There are other racist and corrupt white cops , and for a twist we have some black pimps and dealers who sell out their black partners in crime.  Really there isn't too much to say about the movie, it's a Blaxploitation, we all know how this bad films ends.  I do get a kick of Lt. Pope slamming the Captain down calling him a racist sob (which he is) and the Captain having the gall to change the subject: ""You want my job, don't you!!!""  Not really he just wants you to stop being a white beatnik racist.  Anyhow only for true movie collectors of this type of cinema everyone else should avoid it."
0,"I would like to say that unlike many of the people who disliked this film and found it impossible to understand I was fully able to understand it for what it is.. A very incoherent attempt at a plot line.  I don't like to toss this word around but in this case it fits very well. The director firstly presents the material in an extremely ""arrogant"" way and worse, extremely incoherently. It is incoherent in that it presents the material in a messy dislodged order, making us think that the director was too drunk to remember which scenes come first, and arrogant in that at 2 hours long they expect us, the viewer to CARE by the end of it.  I respect surrealist cinema for what it is. (creating a story around a more than real world that does not tie to real life) But there is nothing surreal about having a story placed in ordinary modern times, and a modern day earth setting, that is most importantly not able to engage the audience but furthermore, simply a dislodged series of events that barely tie together. The most accurate way to describe the experience of viewing this film is like viewing a story; perhaps even a very GOOD story as it was based on a book, but being frustrated by the fact that the camera doesn't seem to capture the necessary moments and tie together any means of coherence.  Let's compare stylistic cinema. Compare Gaspar Noe's ""Seul contre tous"" to this. He gave us a coherent, extremely engaging and intellectually deep story. This movie offers no intellectual study, and while it is very stylistic in it's fragmented presentation, the director has ultimately abandoned the essential art of good storytelling and all we are left with is a mess of events that barely tie in together.  Yes indeed it IS possible to make sense of things.... to a POINT. But as i said earlier the viewer will reach a stage where they simply say ""Who cares."" It plays out like watching a drab mundane story of a man going to a supermarket and buying groceries in uncronological order. Even with murders it is completely uninteresting and unengaging. Too many people these days will give high marks to something they are unable to understand or make sense of simply for fear of looking foolish, and in every way this film TRIES to make the viewer look foolish.  If you have too much time on your hands, then please watch this film, taking into account what I have said of it. It is a story based on a book that could have been presented in a MUCH more effective way and that is my bottom line reasoning."
1,"Back to the roots with ""like it is in heaven"" - what are the real values of life? These Swedes carve out a message that appeals to every heart. We've seen it twice now in a cinema packed to the last seat: love pure and joy within the music of a choir that's simple, yet full of power once everyone finds his or her inner tone.   From the glitter of fame to the school of of his youth, now empty and ready to be adapted as his new home after collapsing on stage, Daniel wants to start listening and is drawn into the lives of the simple, warm and rough people of the North.  He wins the hearts with music and gains the capacity to love and be loved unconditionally.  Don't go see it if you've been normed to Hollywood. This stuff contains no extras, just your laughter, your compassion, your tears!"
0,"I saw this movie not knowing anything about it before hand. The plot was terrible with large gaps of information missing. The movie didn't have the ""battle of wits"" feel to me. The actors just spewed out mouthful's of nonsense, at times causing me to gnash my teeth in agony as they droned on and on. The plot was predictable except for the stomach sickening homo erotic scene at the end (I'm not homophobic but made me physically sick to my stomach), even the ending was predictable. And you could tell the detective was Jude Law in a costume, everything from the fake accent, terrible dental work, costume shop facial hair, everything pointed to it being a disguise. The whole movie just felt like wasted time out of my life. This movie had the feel of a puppet show with Jude Law and Michael Caine as puppets and the house as the window to view the show, really boooring in my opinion."
2,"Okay, the make-up and sfx (or lack thereof) are simply ridiculous, but that in a way adds to the fun. The movie is cleverly written, with some definite and obvious nods towards Quentin Tarantino's style of pop culture infused script. The naked for the hell of it zombies are swell, and the movie delivers more than a few decent chuckles. I think an attempt to make viewers more aware of this films spoof nature, as opposed to actual ""scary zombie"" would garner it a more wide spread enjoyment. The spaceship angle is a bit goofy, but plays up the randomness of the Romero films, with the ""why did this just start happening"" aspect. And the preacher going off on his church was a clever bit. For a micro-budget film, this one really is worth picking up and giving a view."
2,"X (Live Action) ---------------   The idea behind 'X' is rather good. It is about the clashes of powers of Earth and heavens. Each of these are represented by Dragons of some sort, each dragon has a unique skill. The Dragons fight in Tokyo, as the earth dragons want to destroy humanity and let nature take over Earth as it once were. That pretty much sums it up. The animation of ""X"" is okay as well - the backgrounds are well done, and the characters are ... artistic. But unfortunately, these two elements combine into a horrible film. The characters lack character, the plot lacks story. Actually what kept me going was the question: ""what am I watching this for, anyway?!"".   When you actually get to the end (yes, there is one!), you get very disappointed - the last and most important fight (that will determine the fate of Earth) lasts about 20 seconds. The dubbing (sorry, we had some subtitles issues) is awful. Everybody's yelling like they're half - conscious, there's no feel or a touch to it. Actually, the best thing about this title is that it ends and that I DON'T OWN IT. As this is based on a series, even the most fanatic fans should boycott this terrible motion picture... Total waste of time."
2,"In this true coming-of-age story, young Matt is ready to leave his one-horse town and travel with his best friend Schultz. The only thing keeping him in town is his father's garage, which isn't doing good business. He doesn't want to abandon his father, and decides to stick around a little longer (of course, falling for the new girl only helps solidify his decision).  Schultz wants to leave more than anything, because he's in an abusive home, but Matt still doesn't want to fully make up his mind. Only after a tragic event does Matt finally realize that he has to look out for himself and not for others.  ""The Garage"" delivers in every aspect. You're drawn into the story and equally as drawn to Matt and the predicament he finds himself in. Its stirring, moving, and profound in a very low-key way. Definitely worth a viewing."
2,"You know that one guy who'd do anything to get you fired, destroy your house, alienate you from your friends and family, chew through your surge protector? You know, the usual. Well, imagine if that guy was a poodle-sized sewer rat.  I wondered going into this movie why Peter Weller would agree to star in what is essentially the rat-equivalent of Jaws: The Revenge. I got my answer about twenty seconds into the film, where it opens on a shot of Shannon Tweed, playing Weller's wife here, showering. Umm, okay.  She leaves, along with Weller's extremely dimwitted kid to stay at a hotel (only to pop up later in the movie scantily-clad back in her hotel or in a dream sequence in order to meet some strange 80s boob quota I suppose).  Weller is doing fine by himself, (staying behind to finish some work), until the dishwasher overflows, eventually upsetting a rat who decides to move into his apartment. Its hard to gauge just how big this thing is supposed to be until it decides to crawl up under the covers in Weller's bed later, apparently he's the size of a tomcat.  Weller does his best to get rid of the rat, upgrading from normal rat traps to (what are basically) miniature bear traps. When the medieval rat traps don't work or come back gnawed on he decides to get a cat, which also comes back gnawed on (or replaced with a cheap stuffed animal that resembles his cat). When he decides to ignore the rat he chews on on his surge protector, fuse box, and therein cutting off the power.  Weller runs around the house, bashing holes into walls in search of the rat, is plagued by nightmares of birthday parties where the giant rat jumps out of a sheet cake (?), and where his dimwitted kid ends up mixing in various rat poisons in with his cereal. The finale brought to mind Arachnophobia as it ended in a dank basement; the film ending maybe twelve seconds after the rat's been dispatched as Weller brushes himself off as if the last two hours hadn't just happened just in time to greet his wife and kid at the front door. I'm sure they won't notice the completely demolished apartment."
2,"Originally a professional dancer, when Cagney went into acting, his original aspiration was the 'legitimate stage,' i.e. Broadway or off-Broadway, but ended up in Hollywood, where the real money was. Eventually he ran afoul of two institutions of the Hollywood studio system - the almost 'indentured servant' status of acting contracts, and type-casting. The first meant doing whatever the studio said, and the second meant that what the studio told him was to play the racketeer personality that had sold ""Public Enemy"" in film after film. Cagney rebelled, going long periods not making films, and insisting on casting against type. Finally he formed Cagney productions, which produced this film and a handful of others, most of which were box-office thuds.  To be fair to the studios on the issue of type-casting, they really understood their audiences of the '30s and '40s. By the mid-'50s, a new generation of mature audiences could approach an actor as something other than face for a type, but there's no doubt that earlier audiences expected their stars to be pretty much true to the characters they most usually played. Cagney was a particular victim of this syndrome. Of all his non-tough-guy films, only ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" made a lot of money and earned enduring critical respect.  ""The Time of Your Life"" isn't just a filmed play that Cagney appears in. His character is the whole story. He has a mysterious past, appears to be well-to-do but prefers a shadowy existence in a lower-class dive, has nothing but good-will for the world, with a wry, wizened sense of humor, yet there is a strange underlying sadness or depression in his make-up that is never fully revealed let alone explained. All this is not just the writing at work, but is present in Cagney's powerful, understated performance. In fact, we're so conditioned by actors 'emoting' in dramas or playing stony strongmen in action films, that we have forgotten what 'subtle' really means in an acting style, but here Cagney exhibits it in spades. Unlike the 'method' actors of the same era as this film, who try to 'get inside' their characters as much as possible, Cagney recognizes the need to take the script as a blueprint for the actor's constructing character. This Joseph T. is as much Cagney's creation as it is Saroyan's - really more so. Cagney creates a fully-developed personality that could easily walk off the screen and down the street to the neighborhood bar. And you could walk up to him ad engage a pretty lively conversation.  It is true that the film making here is unexceptional - despite a couple remarkable close-ups, it's really a 'filmed play' in the lesser senses of that term. And the supporting actors are rarely as spot-on as Cagney. As for the story itself, well, let's be fair, it's Saroyan, an amusing bit of 'Americana.'  But the box-office failure of this film was undeserved, and so is its continuing reputation as something of a failure for Cagney's career. If you approach the film with an open mind, you'll realize that Cagney here leaves us a classic example of what pre-'method' acting really was, and what acting ought to be about. If you set aside expectations and pre-conceptions, you may find yourself utterly fascinated - and captivated - by Cagney's performance here."
2,"A divorced dad and son attempt to build on their newly resurrected relationship by heading back to pop's hometown named Salem in up-state Maine.When he gets there,he finds that all the townspeople have turned into 300-year-old vampires.""A Return to Salem's Lot"" by Larry Cohen is not as bad as it's reputed to be.In fact I used to watch it pretty often when I was a kid.Of course it's not as scary or suspenseful as Tobe Hooper's ""Salem's Lot"",but it still manages to entertain if you are in the right mood.The acting is terrible as is the make-up of the vampires,but there is enough amusing moments to make the viewer smile.Samuel Fuller is quite memorable as a Vampire slayer.Overall,""A Return to Salem's Lot"" is a quirky,occasionally uneven horror film that is worth a look for fans of Larry Cohen's unusual horror movies.7 out of 10 and that's being kind."
2,"Watch this move and don't compare it somehow to ""The Cure"", by Peter Horton is impossible, once the backbones are too seemed.

Two parent that have been there in the boy's first steps and first words now have to be there in his first and only death.  The suffering and the living of this family ""are"" the story, and the lesson we can take from them are wide and simple at the same time.  A must see..."
2,"What is the point of this documentary? From a film perspective this was not worthwhile. The film & editing was bad. It seems that much of the film was a forum for someone's favorite iTunes list. Many images are frankly irrelevant to the film. Little continuity. I think the filmmaker is stuck with footage that cannot be redone and somehow threw it all together. I'm amazed that anyone is rallying behind this as a film.  I understand that in a crisis situation such as this, some footage will be choppy, shaky, etc which adds to the experience of the crisis. However, even in the controlled environments - interviews after the fact - the camera shakes, moves in & out unnecessarily, and gives ridiculous close-ups. There was precious little information about any pet rescue. A few statistics thrown in.  Jane Garrison's story is compelling and this should be more about her alone. Sub-lines would be the inter-agency conflicts, the animal murders by law enforcement, and REUNIONS with pets. A fuller investigation of these on film would make it worthwhile.  I think there are many promising story lines that are just dropped. What is in the film does not gel at all to make a documentary. The film ends with some random images from the Barkus pet parade. What connection did this have to anything about the animal rescue, just because it was New Orleans? I'm getting even more angry as I type, thinking how much of a waste this was."
2,"**WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD** Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself is postmodern nihilism at its worst. Nothing funny in this film. The characters are grotesque, self-centered, disloyal and dysfunctional. Harbour is the only likeable person; a man who gives selflessly of himself to his suicidal younger brother and everyone else in his life, only to be betrayed and scorned (even by his own parents). No one can give a reason for living to Wilbur because life is just ""here"" with no ultimate reason or reference to God. Harbour nevertheless tries to help Wilbur best he can. Wilbur procedes to ""repay"" his brother by having an affair with his wife, who claims to ""love"" Harbour. The affair continues even after Harbour is diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. When asked what a near death experience was like for Wilbur (white light?)he responds ""nothing. Just blackness and silence."" Lovely. Harbour, rather than try to go on fighting a almost certain death sentence from cancer, commits suicide in the hopes his brother will honor his promise to look after his wife and stepdaughter, giving Wilbur a reason to live. His grave not even cold yet, Wilbur visits hand in hand with his brother's widow and stepdaughter talking of marriage (we all know how sacred those vows are to them. Why even bother?)The movie ends at a graveyard, replete with bleak scenery that leaves you disturbed, angry for what happened to Harbour, and perhaps even wishing everyone else BUT Harbour had killed themselves. Sartre would have liked this movie, but not even one as twisted as he would dare to have labeled this trash as ""comedy."""
1,"Salva and his pal Bigardo have been at the margin of the law during most of their lives. We see them panhandling in a car of the underground, where their pitch to get donations is so lame, no one gives them anything! Salva, who is a hardened petty criminal doesn't even have any redeeming qualities, that is, until he discovers a reality show on television that gives him the idea of what to do next. Religion and show business prove to be a winning combination, something that Salva capitalizes on.  He and Bigardo have been in jail after the accidental death of a priest that was critical of the duo. Salva shows he is a natural for the reality show. He transforms himself into a Christ-like figure who is an instant success in the program. Espe, who is a no-nonsense woman who is show's producer, can't escape from the way Salva pays her unusual attention. Ultimately, Salva is the victim of his own success in the end.  Jordi Molla, whose first directorial job this movie is, had some success in the way the film satirizes the role of television. Spain, which was vulnerable to these types of programs, has seen its share of the bizarre, which is what the director felt is an assault on the viewing public and wanted to set his story from the point of view of the people that are making a fortune out of the naive audience.  The ensemble cast has some good moments in the film. Mr. Molla, like any actor who decides to direct his first feature, would have been more effective concentrating on the picture in front of the camera. Candela Pena, a good actress, is one of the best reasons for watching the movie. Juan Carlos Villedo, David Gimenez Cacho, Franco Francescoantonio, Florinda Chico and the rest responded well to the new director."
1,"I used to watch this on either HBO or Showtime or Cinemax during the one summer in the mid 90's that my parents subscribed to those channels. I came across it several times in various parts and always found it dark, bizarre and fascinating. I was young then, in my early teens; and now years later after having discovered the great Arliss Howard and being blown away by ""Big Bad Love"" I bought the DVD of ""Wilder Napalm"" and re-watched it with my girlfriend for the first time in many years. I absolutely loved it! I was really impressed and affected by it. There are so many dynamic fluid complexities and cleverness within the camera movements and cinematography; all of which perfectly gel with the intelligent, intense and immediate chemistry between the three leads, their story, the music and all the other actors as well. It's truly ""Cinematic"". I love Arliss Howard's subtle intensity, ambivalent strength and hidden intelligence, I'm a big fan of anything he does; and his interplay with Debra Winger's manic glee (they are of course married) has that magic charming reality to it that goes past the camera. (I wonder if they watch this on wedding anniversaries?.......""Big Bad Love"" should be the next stop for anyone who has not seen it; it's brilliant.) And, Dennis Quaid in full clown make-up, sneakily introduced, angled, hidden and displayed by the shot selection and full bloomed delivery is of the kind of pure dark movie magic you don't see very often. Quaid has always had a sinister quality to him for me anyways, with that huge slit mouth span, hiding behind his flicker eyes lying in wait to unleash itself as either mischievous charm or diabolical weirdness (here as both). Both Howard and Quaid have the insane fire behind the eyes to pull off their wonderful intense internal gunslinger square-offs in darkly cool fashion. In fact the whole film has a darkly cool energy and hip intensity. It's really a fantastic film, put together by intelligence, imagination, agility and chemistry by all parties involved. I really cannot imagine how this got funded, and it looks pretty expensive to me, by such a conventional, imagination-less system, but I thank God films like this slip through the system every once in awhile. In a great way, with all of its day-glo bright carnival colors, hip intelligence, darkly warped truthful humor and enthralling chemistry it reminds me of one of my favorite films of all time: ""Grosse Pointe Blank"".......now that's a compliment in my book!"
2,"Well, since I watched this movie for the third time, I must like this rubbish, no? Damn right I do! This is one pretty bad PREDATOR rip-off. Actually, this movie borrows so many elements from so many other movies, you can't even bother beginning to count them. Jürgen Prochnow looks like he's on cocaine or something, over-acting every line he speaks intensely. He looks pretty insane as the mad scientist with no conscience or morality. Mark Dacascos plays a doctor (haha!) who suddenly turns into Rambo (hoho!) or (more appropriate) into Major Alan""Dutch""Schaeffer (hihi!). The special effects are hilarious (that helicopter crash!!!) and the monster-suit is cool (with red & green colors). Of course it looks extremely rubbery. Plus: that annoying native kid gets killed! Way to go scriptwriter! So yes, this is rubbish, but of the enjoyable kind!"
2,"Chances are, if you are only casually aware of the world that you live in, your life imitates that of the Finzi-Continis, one of two families depicted in this film.   The beginning of de Sica's film follows the state of affairs in Italy shortly after the Fascist government of Mussolini has declared the ordinary tennis clubs off limits for Italian Jews-just the beginning for the Government's separatist stance. The Jews in town react in various ways: Giorgio, who is in love with the daughter of the Finzi-Continis, is enraged; his father his philosophical; Giorgio's brother is upset only after being sent to France to study, and later, finding out to his horror about the German concentration camps. To the Finzi-Continis, though, it doesn't really matter. They're different from the other Jews because wealth and privilege have bred them into a family as proud as it is vulnerable. They hardly seem to know, or even care, about the fact that their rights are slowly being taken away. It seems that years of prestige and social status have put them above the laws of the land.  The walled garden of the Finzi-Continis is a symbol for the false security that people retain, unaware that problems on the outside may force them into reality. The garden of the film seems to promise that nothing will change and that everything will remain the same. Interestingly, de Sica films the garden in a way that enforces this theme of false security. He never orients us visually with the rest of the city, so we can never tell how big or how small the garden is. Have you ever felt uneasy being somewhere not knowing the exact dimensions of your boundary? That's the feeling we get here with shots of the garden that seem to stretch on forever.   The Garden of the Finzi-Continis is a great film for many reasons, one of which is how it forces us to take a proactive stance regarding the world that we live in. There's nothing wrong with feeling secure but it's important to try to take an objective stance with reference to the world that we live in. And you certainly don't want to be on the outside looking in to those who have realized it already."
2,"This movie is great fun to watch, like you would expect from a genre movie such as this one. It has all the typical adventurous, action and comedy elements present to make this a great swashbuckling movie. Add to that Douglas Fairbanks in good shape and you have a classic unforgettable genre movie!  Douglas Fairbanks is totally great in this one. He looks, acts, breaths, eats like a real superstar. He handles all of the athletic action in the movie really well. It's not hard to see why this man was THE swashbuckling hero of the '20's.  The movie is really great looking, with many grand looking sets. Really great looking stuff! (though obviously all fake.) Something you would normally expect to see in a D.W. Griffith movie. The movie also has some silly looking but yet great early special effects, toward the ending of the movie.  The story has all the ingredients needed for such a genre movie as this one; an heroic main character, a love interest, stereotypical villains and lots of fun and action. Especially toward the ending the movie starts to become greatly adventurous after a sort of slower middle and good first part. It's of course all rather simple and formulaic but this is also what makes the genre so great. You just always know what to expect. It's good simple fun that's professionally and well made, that's also beautiful to look at.  Also definitely fun to see how much of this movie was later used again in Disney's ""Aladdin"". Some, mostly action sequences, are obviously almost directly copied.  A great fun movie, from swashbuckling-specialist director Raoul Walsh.  9/10"
0,"Look, I loved the PROPER Anchorman film, but this was reaaaaallly bad. The kind of bad that makes you wish you could get that time back in your life, the kind of bad that makes you think ""what on Earth were they thinking to film this in the first place"", the kind of bad that makes you wish you'd taken 50 more minutes when stepping into the kitchen to grab a snack during the film, the kind of bad that makes leprosy look fun, the kind of bad that makes you think you wish you rented a Pauly Shore film instead....seriously, I cannot explain how very bad this was.  Having said that....there were some semi-amusing laughs, but they are all so much LESS funny than Anchorman. Sure, they tried to make it entertaining and fun, but the entire subplot that was left out of Anchorman that made it here was genuinely left out for a good reason...it wasn't even a little bit good.  Do yourself a favour (or in the USA, a favor), and don't watch this DVD...it will tarnish the good movie that Anchorman is and you don't want to do that.  Okay...I'm alright now."
2,"For the love of God Ron... 122M  for this... Probably the worsts Blockbuster of the year, and maybe the decade.  2.30 minutes of suffering. Bad construction of the plot, there are times in the movie that u are filled with info and others that u are thinking what u will eat tomorrow for lunch...  The caracthers are median... Tom go away... Audrey not bad and Sir Ian probably only the good cause for a 5 ticket...  I really don't like the changes that the production made to the book, specially in the end of the movie. And for God sake, the end with a praying Tom above Louvre's piramid... Simply hillarius.  I'd like to see wath a good director would do with something like this."
2,"City of Ember isn't perfect, but I personally enjoyed it, and so did my family. I admit I haven't read the book, but I am the sort of person who likes to judge adaptations on their own merits. The film does look phenomenal, the set design is intricately crafted and the costumes are beautiful. And the special effects are mind-blowing, not the best special effects ever but not the worst, far from it. The soundtrack is also rousing and fun, the story is intriguing, the script is decent and the acting is very well done. Both Harry Treadaway and Saoirse Ronan(the better of the two) give appealing lead performances while Amy/Catherine Quinn is very cute as Lina's little sister Poppy. Bill Murray is deviously obnoxious as the slob of a mayor if there ever was one. However, despite the impressive visuals and performances, there are some problems. One is that while Tim Robbins is a good actor, he is given little to do as Doon's father. Second, the ending felt rather abrupt, the film could've done with a more rounded finish. Thirdly, the pacing is rather slow and drawn out at times particularly in the middle half. This is probably not helped by the occasionally sluggish direction.

2,"In 1870 Philadelphia, faint-hearted Don Knotts (as Jesse W. Heywood) obtains a license in dentistry, and decides to spread ""dental health through the west like a plague."" After his stagecoach is held up, Mr. Knotts joins a wagon train. He plays horsey with buxom Barbara Rhoades (as Penelope Cushings) and dresses up as a fetching Indian squaw. Is Knotts' character bisexual? The ending leaves the question unanswered. Gun smugglers Jackie ""Uncle Fester"" Coogan and Don ""Red Ryder"" Barry head off an able supporting cast. Vic Mizzy's wild, wild western music resembles his own ""Green Acres"".

2,"Let me say bravo to the cast,crew and director you all should be proud a film I was lucky enough to see at the HMC film fest with a packed theater. Not only did it win awards,it won over the Audience so props to all involved I can't wait till the next one comes out."
0,"Currently, this film is listed on IMDb as the 42nd worst film ever made--which is exactly why I rented it from NetFlix. However, I am saddened to report that the film, while bad, is no where near bad enough to merit being in the bottom 100 films ever made list. I have personally seen at least 100 films worse than this one. Hardly a glowing endorsement, but it just didn't meet the expected level of awfulness to be included on this infamous list.  The film begin with Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew on their belated honeymoon (by the way, they are married in real life as well). He's a doctor who is obsessed with bats and insists they go to a nearby cave. Once there, they behave very, very, very stupidly (hallmark of a bad film) and are soon bitten by a bat. According to this film, bats love to attack people and there are vampire bats in the US--both of which are not true at all.  Oddly, after being bitten, the man doesn't even bother going to the hospital!! The first thing on anyone's mind (especially a doctor) is to get medical help immediately, but not this boob. Soon, he's having seizures--yet he STILL isn't interested in seeking help! Again and again you keep thinking that this must be the stupidest couple in film history!!   After a while, he eventually goes to see a doctor and is sent to the hospital. But, by then it's too late and his attacks become more violent and he begins killing people to suck their blood. When it's totally obvious to everyone that the man is a crazed killing machine, the wife (who, like her husband, has a grapefruit for a brain) refuses to believe he's dangerous--even after he attacks people, steals an ambulance and runs a police car off the road!!   Now most of the time Moss is going through these episodes, his eyes roll back and he looks like a normal person. Oddly, however, a couple times he develops bat-like hands and towards the end they used some nice prosthetics on him to make him look quite bat-like. Had this been really cheesy, the film would have merited a 1.  In the very end, in a twist that hardly made any sense at all, the wife inexplicably turned into a crazed bat lady and had a swarm of bats kill the evil sheriff. How all this was arranged was a mystery as was Moss' and McAndrew's belief that this film would somehow help their careers--though they both have had reasonably long careers on TV playing bit roles since 1974.  Overall, very dumb. The plot is silly and makes no sense and strongly relies on people acting way too dumb to be real. Not a good film at all, but not among the worst films of all time either.  NOTE: For some reason, IMDb shows the graphic for the three DVD set for IT'S ALIVE and it's two sequels of the web page for THE BAT PEOPLE. While THE BAT PEOPLE has been seen with the title ""It's Alive"", the two movies are not at all related. It's easy to understand the mistake--especially since they both came out in 1974, but the movie I just reviewed starred Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew and the other film starred John Ryan and Sharon Farrell."
0,"I can't stand most reality shows and this one is worst than the one with Paris Hilton, and sure it's his company. But ""you're fired"" or ""you're hired"", for how many seasons now? After watching the show I wouldn't want to work for the guy with his ego and all and I think watching paint dry has more entertainment valve.  I'd love to hear just one person get up and say ""Donald I quit and take some of your money and buy a decent hairdo"". I see he's even trying to buy fame in the wrestling WWE. I hope he gets hurt so I don't have to see his pathetic face anymore. It must be sad to want fame so bad and have no talent and make an ass of yourself trying to buy it. I'd give this show a negative mark if I could but it gets a 1 and it doesn't deserve that."
0,"This third Pokemon movie is too abstract for younger kids to follow and too repetitious to entertain older kids. The message of the film-- about dealing with loss-- is subverted by the return of the young girl's father during the film's credits. Team Rocket provide some amusement, but they're not really part of the small plot, so they don't appear very often."
1,"Love it or loathe it, it's hard to not find Warren Beatty's take on ""Dick Tracy,"" the 1990 film adaptation of Chester Gould's famous comic strip, anything short of a genre classic. Superhero films have been coming out of the woodwork in recent years, and may soon become a genre all on its own.  Beatty's film liberally uses Gould's source material to full effect, shooting in all six of the strip's primary colors, and thus giving this unique yet familiar world of trigger-happy mutant gangsters and loose, seductive women a lush visual style and tone.  It can be stated that the film's strong visual aesthetics drastically short-change the characters and their acting abilities, which I don't think can be any further from the truth.  ""Dick Tracy"" relishes in its look and ghastly characters, and Beatty himself, who plays the dogged and incorruptible detective of the title, is appropriately stoic and ready to bust the bad guys at any and all costs.  Other than the visual treats and Oscar-winning makeup, there is a plot, and Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino, deliciously over-the-top in an Oscar-nominated performance), seeks to eliminate Tracy in one well-planned move, but also seeks to gain control of all criminal action in the city by uniting all the feuding gangs under him.  Tracy, meanwhile, is juggling his relationship with Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly), who as her name would have it, remains faithfully by his side and cares for The Kid (Charlie Korsmo), who eventually finds a father figure to look up to in our crime-busting hero. Tracy's fidelity to Tess is tested by the tempting advances of Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), who is also Big Boy's main squeeze. At the same time that all of this is going down, things become heated when a new criminal figure arrives in town, and decides to play both sides against the middle.  The performances are good, as Beatty's focus on the strained and romantic relationships between each of the leads becomes the center of the material, as opposed to just concentrating on pointless action and special effects. Pacino freely chews up the scenery in a role that's truly standout from the rest.  ""Dick Tracy"" is one of the best and most overlooked of the comic book movie genre. I think that if Chester Gould was still alive, he would be proud of Warren Beatty's take on his beloved crime-fighting detective.  8/10"
1,"Although I really enjoyed Jim Carrey's latest ""serious"" performances (""The Truman Show"", ""Man on the Moon""), I've always thought his real genious lies in physical comedy. This is not to say he is a fantastic, talented actor: those bozos at the Academy Awards seem to dislike him so much, he has never had a (truly deserved) nomination or award. Well, any ""institution"" that nominates for 11 Oscars a bore such as ""Titanic"" shouldn't be taken seriously.  On with the review. ""The Grinch"" is the sweetest, best looking, best acted, more enjoyable seasons film since ""The Nightmare before Christmas"". Both movies seem very similar, too, with their highly stylized sets and the premise of someone stealing Christmas. Both make their principal actors seem like the villains (one in a higher degree than the other), both pack a strong moral lesson, and both are truly enjoyable.  That is, until you realize that Jack Skellington is a doll, and The Grinch is a human being. But a human being that is so incredibly expressive, so fluid in his movements, so cartoon-like, so unreal, that never gets in the way of the movie. He can be hilarious, he can be a sad soul, he can be angry. He lives in a 3-dimensional world, where 3-dimensional people live. He jokes, he laughs, he cries, and ultimately he saves the Christmas. I loved this film to bits, and cannot wait for it to come out on DVD. This is one of those films you will really enjoy 10, 20 years from now. As timeless as they come."
2,"Director Baltasar Kormakur leaves Iceland to make an American movie, except he really doesn't, and that's a large part of the problem. Kormakur actually shot this film in Iceland, and it would take a hyper-credulous viewer to accept these stark landscapes as Minnesota. ""Heaven"" is a dark tale about insurance fraud. Dark in every sense of the word, as several early scenes are nearly invisible. The plot is murky; the cast's accents are all over the lot, especially Forest Whitaker's. Whitaker's attempts at Minnesotan leave him somewhere between Duluth and Dublin. The ending is intended to be richly ironic, but falls absolutely flat. For a far better experience, see Kormakur's ""101 Reykjavik."""
2,"In Britain, there is a drink called PG Tips. It's a kind of tea. It's quite nice. I personally enjoy it with a splash of milk and two generous spoonfuls of sugar. During the 90's it was the biggest selling tea in Britain, even outselling the tea conglomerate Typhoo. The reason for this was a clever marketing campaign featuring even cleverer monkeys who read the newspaper and erm, drink tea and stuff. During the 70's, the chimps were taken off the air only to be brought back 18 months later with PG tips facing rapidly declining sales. See? Chimps can do good stuff. In the name of moderniazation and er, animal rights (what's that?), the chimps have again been taken off the air and replaced with claymation bird models. However, clever Hollywood types sat up and took notice. People like monkeys. They look like people! But funnier! Ha Ha! Funny-like-people-monkeys!!!!!! Forcibly and hungrily breast-feeding itself on the PG tips monkey's success comes MXP, where chimps do all the things they were born to do: snowboarding, shaving, cooking and faithfully re-enacting the plots of all the Home Alone movies. This is not a film not to watch because you don't like monkeys. This is not a film not to watch because you are a card carrying member of PETA. This is a film not to watch because you will gnaw your own arm off and wish you were dead. No animals were harmed during the filming. Let us hope the same can not be said of the actors, producer, director and all involved in this sad, sad movie made for (and by) people who like gnawing their arm off and wishing they were dead."
2,"Oh I loved this movie!! It was so exciting!! It seemed like John and Karen were never going to escape. It was, however, a little bit exaggerated about all the horrors that the poor couple lived there. The character of Poe was cartoonish. But the film was so enjoyable. I can't wait to see the sequel!!"
2,"I recently picked up Keoma as part of Anchor Bay's ""Once Upon a Time In Italy"" collection. This handy box-set also included ""Texas Adios"", ""A Bullet For The General"", ""Companeros"", and ""Four Of The Apocalypse"". After reading some pretty glowing reviews for Keoma, I had high hopes and expected it to be the best if not one of the better films included. Boy was I wrong!  While the film itself was fairly interesting and included some nice touches (especially an unexpected appearance by character actor ""Woody Strode"" - and some cleverly shot flashback sequences), it had an ""overdone"" quality to it. They were trying too hard for a ""masterpiece"". Mainly, this movie was plagued with the worst score I've ever had the misfortune to hear! The music itself wasn't the problem. What was however, were the annoying-as-hell female and male vocalists used to narrate the action throughout the movie. God they were AWFUL!!! They wouldn't shut up!   In the future, I plan to re-watch Keoma with the sound muted. That's the only way I feel I could sit through it again! Who knows? Maybe I'll enjoy it! I really wanted to like this movie.   I wouldn't normally recommend a movie that I gave a 4 of 10 rating for, but If you can rent this one, you need to hear the score just for laughs."
0,"Judging from this film and THE STRONG MAN, made the same year, I would not place Harry Langdon at the top of the list of great silent screen comedians. There simply is not enough there. Perhaps he was on his way to developing his style but sabotaged himself by taking his first big successes too seriously. In any event, all of his tricks are reminiscent of the greater funny men, but he lacks the acrobatic skills of Keaton and the prodigious ingenuity of Lloyd. He also undermines his own persona by dressing and walking like Chaplin's tramp character. His trademarks are childlike innocence, timidity of approach and a tendency to under-react to calamity by looking perplexed, batting his eyes or touching his pursed lips with the tip of his forefinger. The comedy in Langdon's films results from fate throwing various obstacles in his path which he tries to overcome in wimpy or naïve ways or with a minimum of physicality, such as throwing rocks at an approaching tornado to drive it away, propping up a collapsing building with a two-by-four or dodging boulders by lifting a leg so that they roll under him. In this story, about the son of a shoemaker who joins a cross-country walking race to publicize a rival company's footwear, he manages to win by sheer luck. There is nothing here that hasn't been done far better by the Big Three."
2,"Michael J. Fox earned every penny he got from the industry, and it's with films like this that I feel he is vastly undervalued by the movie watching public. This cheeky and funny film is criminally rated low for reasons I just can't begin to fathom, it's got a sharp script with a very honest message driving it on.  It's concept of putting a big fish in a little pond is always a tale worth telling, and who better than M J Fox to realise the big fish character here,? he has the quips, the sarcasm, and most of all an aura of believability to the character of Dr. Benjamin Stone. The film pans out as one would expect, but the fun is there to be had by all, and come the finale it's just flipping lovely cinema. Get into the vibe of a big city Doctor stuck in a small southern American town, a place that a big city Doctor can't quite comprehend, a place where big city folk surely can't function properly?? The supporting cast are just fine here, Julie Warner, Barnard Hughes, Woody Harrelson & Bridget Fonda are all in on the fun, and all of them give performances in keeping with this other side of the fence comedy. It's a smart and undervalued piece that deserves a better rating than this particular site gives it.  ""I'm in the Twilight Zone"" 8/10."
2,"Someone said this is the best Farrelly's movie since ""There's Something About Mary"". Fact is the Farrelly's haven't done much since "".. About Mary"" except for ""Shallow Hal"" which at least had a decent story and good acting. And while ""Shallow Hal"" won't go down as a classic, it was certainly better than ""Stuck On You"" - which, quite simply, it shouldn't have been. ""Stuck on You"" had the POTENTIAL to be an above average comedy, with an original hook (siamese twins) and two excellent actors in Damon and Kinnear. And while there are glimpses of excellent comedy writing, it seems obvious the writer couldn't come up with enough of them to fill out a movie and reverted to standard, cliché'd comedy bits to fill the rest. What a shame. So much promise lost in mediocrity.  This movie isn't worth seeing."
0,"This ludicrous and inept film is certainly the most misguided version of ""Hamlet"" to ever reach the screen. Branagh's approach to the material can only be described as vulgar; going to such lengths as depicting Ophelia in a straight jacket, having Fortinbras' army appear suddenly on the horizon (looking very much like the climax of ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"") when the palace is apparently guarded only by Francisco (who shouts the very un-Shakespearean cry of ""ataaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack"" before being gunned down), and multitudes of star cameos that harken back to the days of Jimmy Cagney's Bottom and Mary Pickford's Kate.  Branagh chose to set his film in an Edwardian setting but at the same time decided to employ an almost uncut text, so that frequently the dialogue that is firmly rooted in Elizabethan mentality makes no sense in the context that it is being performed. And Branagh does not concern himself with such textural subtleties as the ambiguous nature of Hamlet and Olphelia's relationship, treating the audience to a vulgar nude sex scene between the couple that tosses any ambiguity right out the stained glass window.  The uncut text does allow Branagh to indulge in his favorite cinematic pastime: more footage of Kenneth Branagh. This is never so apparent as in the ""How All Occasions Inform Against Me"" speech that ends the first half of the nineteen hour film (at least that's how it feels), which attempts to play to a dramatic crescendo along the lines of Gone With The Wind's ""I'll never be hungry again."" This may serve Branagh's ego, but it does not serve Shakespeare or the speech: when I saw the film in the theater, I leaned over to my companion and snickered ""Great Moments With Mr. Hamlet."" Branagh saves the funniest and most tasteless moment for last, when he attempts to out-do the Olivier film and its justly celebrated death of Claudius by having Hamlet jump from off a high tower onto the monarch, impaling him with a sword. Branagh's Dane does in the king by heroically throwing an apparently magic rapier from across the palace to run through Claudius' heart with a super hero's bulls eye. The only thing that saved the moment from being unbearably maddening was that it was so off-the-wall funny.  While this film has been praised in some quarters as a serious depiction of the tragedy, it is in fact nothing but a star-studded display of a once-talented filmmaker being overtaken by his own narcissism. The Emperor has no clothes, and this Hamlet has nothing to offer but a few unintended laughs and the appalling sight of one man's ego out of control."
2,"Poets ? They're a bit gay aren't they ? Usually they're middle class and middle aged and they get ripped off by scam merchants who post adverts saying "" Send us your poetry submissions for our best selling anthology book of erotic poetry and don't forget to enclose $30 for administration costs "" In short there's nothing less cool than poetry but Miguel Pinero made the genre cool , streetwise and sexy and he deserved a far better biopic than this   I'd never heard of the guy until I saw this movie . A remarkable life story of a man who spent time in the big house and soon achieved critical acclaim via his plays and poetry . He wrote a play called SHORT EYES set in a prison , a play that was turned into a film . Just out of curiosity I went to this site and looked it up . The phrase "" short eyes "" is American prison slang for a child molester the lowest of the low in any penal system . It's also a movie that IMDb reviewers have greatly praised . Now why did I have to visit this site to find out the remarkable story behind the making of the film ( Check out the trivia page on SHORT EYES - I guarantee you'll be amazed ) if I was watching a biopic on the play write behind it ?   By trying to show us how cool and streetwise the eponymous character is the director/screenwriter fails to show us anything about Miguel Pinero the man apart from that he swore and took a lot of drugs which hardly made him a unique individual . The story slips in time and space , from colour to monochrome and has characters appearing and disappearing in a haphazard manner . Miguel Pinero made poetry the new street culture and he probably deserved a better film telling his life story"
2,"I've heard and read on numerous occasions that ""House"" is an incredibly weird and far-out Japanese interpretation of a haunted house movie, but the truth is that absolutely nothing can fully prepare you for how crazy & demented this film really is. To simply label ""House"" as a horror movie would be a serious insult, as this is more like a fairy-tale on hard drugs, a wacko coming-of-age parable and even somewhat of a musical comedy. Even the often encountered description, saying this film is what ""Beetlejuice"" would look like if directed by Dario Argento, comes to naught. If you really must compare this to any other films, then rank it alongside the weirdest cinematic experiments ever made, like ""El Topo"", ""I Walk like a Crazy Horse"" and ""Possession"". I think you can philosophy about the deeper meanings and symbolism of ""Hausu"" for weeks, and every opinion and interpretation could be assumed as correct. Me, personally, I regard the plot as a sort of version of ""Hansel and Gretel"", but with seven Japanese Gretels and no Hansel and with an auntie in a remote creepy castle instead of a witch in a gingerbread cabin in the woods. Summer vacation is coming up, but the holiday plans of the cute teen Oshare abruptly become canceled when his father introduces his new and much younger girlfriend. Instead of traveling with them, Oshare invites her six closest school friends  all of them with adorable nicknames based on their personalities, like Fantasy, Kung-Fu and Melody  to head out to the countryside and pay a visit to Oshare's aunt whom she hasn't seen since her mother died. The aunt's welcoming is extremely warm and gracious, but she as well as her estate and even the white cat Snowflake are nevertheless surrounded with an aura of mystery and creepiness. Agatha Christie style, the girls then subsequently meet their highly imaginative deaths one by one. The girl who's always hungry, for example, has her head replaced by a watermelon and the musical chick literally becomes consumed by the piano. ""House"" is filled with optical illusion special effects that are not exactly terrifying but nevertheless very deadly to the main characters. Even though director Nobuhiko Obayashi maintains the ambiance of a fantasy/fairy-tale movie, the imagery he uses is often bizarrely nightmarish and grim, with decapitated heads in wells and tap-dancing skeletons and whatnot. The girls' characters are beautifully drawn, and hence you feel a lot of sympathy for each and every single one of them, and it's a very stylish film altogether. Especially for being a late 70's movie  when the horror movies were at their most explicitly rancid and exploitative  ""Hausu"" is an artistic and elegant accomplishment and it honestly deserves to be wider known, globally acclaimed and more discussed."
2,"Although everything about this movie (especially the title) suggests that it must be trash, surprisingly enough it isn't. The plot involves a girl who likes reading scary books and one day finds that the events of the book she is reading, called ""I, Madman"", start to repeat themselves in reality. It has the logic of a dream - that is, no logic at all, - but don't see this one for the sake of the plot. What lifts it out of the B-movie pit is the imaginative way the seedy world of trashy novels from the 50s is recreated on screen; the smartly executed shifts between fantasy and reality, past and present; Jenny Wright's appealing and intelligent heroine; and finally, the director's genuine feeling for the atmosphere of time and place. It is a little like a cross between Cornell Woolrich and a mad doctor horror movie. Do not try to figure out why things are happening, just enjoy the way this film is so different from anything else. A totally unexpected pleasure."
1,"Albuquerque is a film that has all the elements of a class A western, except one: the story, that really belongs to a class B or C. That was acceptable at the time the film was made, when people were so thrilled to see a western in color, but nowadays it just looks very primitive. Nonetheless for people who enjoy old westerns, it is entertaining, the original color and sound are very well kept on the DVD that recently came out. Gabby Hayes is a good sidekick, Lon Chaney is mean as always, and Randolph Scott a bit more cheerful than usual. In a film named Albuquerque you would expect to see something that would remind you of the city, but the town that is shown here could be just anywhere."
2,"First viewed this film when it came out. This is an excellent film for the amount of excitement it brings to the viewer. Sure, there are some mistakes in it, such as the weapons used, but that should not detract from the overall excellent story line (which is much like ""Objective Burma"", another excellent film). I believe that it was one of Gary Cooper's finest roles. Fit right in with his overall ""homespun"" personality. Like all films from this era (1950s) it portrayed the American Indian as the villain. History of the Seminole Wars shows just the opposite. But, if one can put that aside, then this is a highly enjoyable movie."
2,"I gather from some of the other comments I've read that the copy I have (on one of those Mill Creek 50 Movie Packs) is missing the first several minutes of the movie. And while it is still easy enough to get the gist of the plot, the background in those minutes would have been nice. That said, I doubt that those extra minutes would have saved this movie. A prominent but discredited doctor tricks a group of criminals onto a ship to continue his experiments on healing the criminal mind, but the criminals have other ideas when they decide to take over the ship. But the doctor also chooses to experiment on the normal person and a lady he presumes is guilty but is actually quite innocent. Things get out of control and go in various directions from here.  There isn't much going for this movie. It's not the worst I've seen, but relatively little happens and there is much more talk than seems fitting for the kind of action/horror movie this seems to want to be. An attempt at comic relief fails, also.  I don't consider the time I spent watching this a total waste of time, but it is the best use of an hour I've spent either."
2,"What makes this movie so wonderful is how good a job Robin Williams and Nathan Lane do as portraying loving, dedicated parents. Aside from the amazing soundtrack and the fun antics, it is their sheer goodness as human beings that stays in your head for a long time.  A fun thing to do is compare this movie to La Cage Aux Folles and see how different characters are interpreted differently. The son in the Birdcage is a much more complex character than the one in La Cage, and a lot of the movie is about him accepting his identity. The daughter, on the other hand, is much more of a three dimensional character in La Cage.  The other nice thing about this movie is that unlike in the original, you end up liking the girls parents to some extent. They actually do have a lot in common with the heroes. That isn't true in La Cage, where the girl's father seems to be almost sinister"
2,"Tripp is a man in his thirties who still lives with his parents. His parents hire Paula to get him to move out. The film manages the set-up, but forgets to fill in the romance.  Matthew McConaughey as Tripp is off-putting to watch, and his accent so thick it is often difficult to understand what he is saying  and baffling, since no one else in the film, including his parents, share his accent. As for the character, he isn't given a personality or any depth, except for a sledge-hammered back story about a dead fiancée, which is dropped in towards the end of the film. Paula (Sarah Jessica Parker) repeatedly mentions how sweet Tripp is, but this sweetness must be going on off screen, as on screen he is constantly a jerk. There is also no chemistry between McConaughey and Parker which makes the so-called romance hard to notice. If it is there at all.  Paula is given even less personality than Tripp. All we know about her is that she gets men to move out of their parents' home professionally. She only refers to Tripp in terms of the job, so when after about half an hour we have to be told Paula has feelings for Tripp, it is a surprise. It certainly isn't in the performance or the dialogue. It would help if we saw she doing her job before being hired in to help Tripp. As it is, it is very confusing how she is so successful since she utterly fails in every aspect of her job with Tripp. And realising she is failing in her job, she sleeps with Tripp  for money. She becomes a prostitute, and doesn't bat an eyelid. How is this not an important plot development?   The film generally doesn't make sense and the scenes in which Tripp is attacked by a chipmunk/dolphin/lizard seem to have wandered in from a different genre, and fail to amuse. However, the scene in which Kit, Paula's house-mate, tries to buy a gun is very funny, the only funny moment of the film, mainly due to the performance by the salesman (Rob Corddry).  As for the supporting cast, Kathy Bates as Tripp's mum hams it up and Zooey Deschanel as Paula's house-mate phones in her usual tediously bored performance  this is obviously her selling point, but strangely enough, a bored actor is boring to watch.  Basically, Failure To Launch is an entirely disengaging film and forgets to actually put any romance in between the set-up and the finale."
0,"Townies is the laziest movie I have ever seen, and I saw the Blair Witch movies (parts one and two). It seems confused in what it wants to be. It's not funny enough for comedy, it's not tragic enough for drama, it's not bloody enough for horror, and it's not good enough for watching. It has scenes of a man doing ""slapstick/bloody"" karate so I think, oh this movie will be in the vein of Toxic Avenger and Street Trash. Then it leaps without warning into a drama about a missing girl, a retarded (mentally handicap) woman and a trusting mother. Then it slaps itself into the ONLY good part in the movie which seems to be set up like a sitcom without the laugh tracks. The part I'm speaking of is a lonely TOWNIE who is so lonely he finds comfort in a rotting corpse. That was the ONLY part of the movie that gave me ANY feeling. The rest was a waist of my life. Then, just to show how CRUEL Wayne is there is a kind of DOCUMENTARY at the end of the film of Wayne (the Director) making fun of Toby (the star) in public. It made me sick. Even though Killer Nerd and Bride of Killer Nerd (two other movies by Wayne) aren't the best, they at least are thought out enough were you can stay entertained until the ending credits. I even like Killer Nerd a bit, it had some great lines I still use to this day.  If you like underground films, if you like overground films, and if you like to watch your feet, just resting were they are, you will not like TOWNIES!  *1/2 (out of ****)  "
2,"This Was probably the one of the best movies i've ever seen. It is a bit of everything eerie,scary,Psychological, and shocking. When i first saw the tcm i was on the edge of my seat. None of it's sequels can compare to the First tcm and, i heard there making a remake it will be nothing like the original.This was a very good movie and, i recommend it to anyone who's in for a real scare. 10/10"
2,"I wish the complete series would come out in Season boxes. I used to sit at home in my room every Sunday evening just before 7. Needing to watch this show. The UST between Kate and Geoff was mainly what kept me going, they are one of the best matched TV-couples I have ever seen. I liked the show less at the end when all the focus turned on 'what was happening in Coopers Crossing' in stead of the 'accident of the week'. Other than that I liked the series from start to end and whenever possible I watch every re-run there is on any channel I can get it... I think it's called an addiction :) I just bought the DVD with 8 episodes (the episodes around Geoff and Kate's wedding and of course the wedding itself) I can't get enough, I hope they bring out more episodes... PLEASE CRAWFORD PRODUCTIONS...."
2,"I attended the premiere of the movie, FOR THE BIBLE TELLS ME SO, at Sundance on January 21, 2007. It is a powerful movie that opens for discussion the impact of religious teaching on homosexuals in America. It gives support to those within the American public who know and deeply care for some gays in their lives and innately feel that God loves all his children and so should they. Every church congregation and Sunday School Class should see this movie as one audience and then have their own discussion. I believe the result would stimulate an acceptance not heretofore anticipated. The naturalness and obvious commitment of the films director and participants make the impact dramatically strong."
2,"It is a bad movie that gives wrong idea out to the public. There is no way that wasting taxpayer's money can be made to look funny. The guy is healthy educated guy and living on his parents money. And then he decides to live off tax payers' money like a parasite. That certainly does not count as funny.   Being a jury is a serious business. Making a comedy is a serious business. Unfortunately, the movie maker seems to care for neither. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It is a waste of time.  The actors did a fairly fine job in the given scope. Story and direction failed the movie."
2,"This movie is so bad it's almost great, on the order of a SHOWGIRLS type fiasco. I recommend finding a copy in some bargain bin or video store and inviting a few sarcastic friends over for lots of laughs. Viewers are supposed to care about the couple (Pamela Sue Martin and Steve Railsback) but the creep-factor is so high whenever Railsback is on screen, it's hard not to shiver with repulsion and fear at him. He looks like he's going to turn into a zombie and eat Pamela Sue's head off at any moment. There is no way anyone like Pamela Sue's sweet and innocent character would get involved with the weirdo Railsback plays! Whoever cast this movie has some 'splainin' to do!  That said, watching the downward spiral of Railsback's character into the drug world is highly entertaining, if only because it brings him into contact with a sweating, primped, slick-haired, and fascinatingly evil Ian McShane. As usual, when McShane is on screen, you cannot take your eyes off him. He plays Railsback's drug contact - and as someone else said - would fit right in as a character in SCARFACE or THE SOPRANOS. He acts everybody out of the water in this one. Mcshane once said he'd 'rather be sh*t in a hit than a hit in sh*t."" Unfortunately, he was definitely the latter in TORCHLIGHT!"
2,"Wow, what a fascinating movie and different kind of film. One really can't get the full impact of this through a review. Anyone who has seen this, I think would agree with me on that.  If I had skipped over the credits and someone had told me Terrence Malick (Days Of Heaven, The New World, The Thin Red Line and Badlands) and directed this film, I would have believed it. Visually, this is his kind of film. I wonder if this movie inspired parts of his latest effort, The New World? There are a number of similarities. Black Robe has the same kind of beautiful and haunting images Malick's films possess but the director in this case is Bruce Bereford, the man who directed Driving Miss Daisy a couple of years before doing this film. DMD also is beautifully-filmed.  Black Robe is not just a piece of art. As great as it is visually, this is a powerful story of a well-intentioned Jesuit priest in the early 17th century who travels to ""New France"" (upstate New York/French Canadian territory) attempting to convert a few area tribes to Christianity. To unbelievers, that seems pushy but Biblically-speaking it is not. Jesus commanded his followers to do just that (Matt. 28:18-20) , so the priest is only doing what missionaries have done for centuries. He also is a good man, stays strong in his beliefs regardless of his own well-being and is a gentle soul. Kudos to the filmmakers for being fair to him.  The Algonquins and the Hurons are also shown with their beliefs, too, and their cultures which obviously were in contrast to the white European-based priest. All sides are shown fairly in this movie, with both positive and negative traits of all.  I was shocked at a few scenes in here, not expecting them as the film has such a gentle flow to it before anything dramatic happens. We see a few sexual scenes and then some brutal violence. The Hurons, particularly, do not want any invasion of their privacy and culture and are openly hostile to the priest and the Algonquins. The story transforms from a quiet Malick-type ""New World"" poetic piece to a violent, suspenseful film and the question is, will the ""good guys"" make it out alive?  The actors in here, perhaps, are not names most people outside Canada are familiar with, including me, but Lothaire Blueteau as Father Laforgue, Aden Young as his assistant ""Daniel"" and Sandrine Holt as Daniel's Algonguin lover ""Anuuka"" are all very, very good. All the characters in this film are very credible people, steadfast in their own beliefs and they come across as realistic people. Most films have unreal people with unrealistic dialog....but not in this movie.  Another big plus was the soundtrack: a lush, haunting score throughout.  Without spoiling the ending, or adding political/theological agendas my own, let me just add that if you enjoy a beautiful-looking movie which also has a thoughtful, haunting story with honest characters, you should check this out. Highly recommended."
2,"this is one of my all time favourites, it's up there with coogan, and, vic and bob  the comedy is so good. some of it is complex, some of it is more obvious, but every single thing in this programme, was thought out, and is comedy gold.  a lot of people don't like it, but really you need to have the right sense of humour, and understanding.  the characters are funny, the horror spoofs are funny, even the way it looks makes me laugh. it's just great.  the fact that there are only 6 episodes is a very sad thing.  i would love to see more, but i think they will leave it as a series that will go down in history to all the people with a great sense of humour, as prolonging the programme may ruin something legendary. however, i still think they should continue in some way, perhaps a new theme. ""garth marenghi's ....."". still with the same type of humour, still made the same way with the same people, put with a different setting, and characters.  anyway this ""garth marenghi's darkplace"" is one of the greatest comedies ever, and i will never forget it."
2,"I tried to spoil my girlfriend, who studies Japanese culture, with a film and it worked! Unagi (the Eal) tells a story of man who commits a 'crime passionelle' by murdering his wife. When he leaves prison the guards bring him 'his' eal. Under supervision of a local priest he tries to live a peaceful peasant-life in a place where nobody knows about his past; he becomes a barber, the eal is his friend ('they never say things you don't like..'). The situation changes when, on instigation of the priest, a girl starts assisting him in his shop. Inevitable his dilemma's come back...  I loved this film for it reminded me much of the films of the Dutch director/producer Alex van Warmerdam; the ordinary, tightly directed up to every detail, the sufficating dilemma's lightly woven thru. Modern drama at it's best!"
2,"Film can be the most fun.  One of the most interesting things about film is how we use them to work out who we are. I'm interested in certain notions of complex abstract reasoning, but the simpler, more obvious stuff is fun too. One of those ""simple"" things is national identity. And there is hardly a better case than how the British defined themselves during the great war. While France rolled over and most Europeans were left to define themselves as humans instead of citizens, the English really turned to film as a nation.  One of the most interesting appropriations was Sherlock Holmes. He has a singular importance in the history of literature, both in terms of placing a discoverer of story in the story, and in terms of being a representative of the (then) new notion that people are motivated and act rationally.  So any movie with Holmes in it, no matter how casual, is loaded, and this one is loaded by bulldozers. Holmes is transported from Victorian times to then modern times. His nemesis here is the guy who played his old opponent: Moriarty.   And there are other transpositions as well. Holmes' interest in science is transformed to a focus on technology, here microfilm, high tech for the time. And the action  after some homeland establishing shots (including a loving mother)  is transported from the UK to the US. And that's the interesting part, because when you are defining your nature, you have the choice by defining it against others.  In this case, we have a parade of American stereotypes. Since it was absolutely clear that the Americans were saving the Brits from extinction, this is done with less edge than usual. But we still have the bullmoose loud senator, the dippy but earnest girlie, the solid naval officer and such. These are woven around landmarks of Washington.  But one stereotype is particularly of interest. In the 40's in the US, black men were railroad porters. By a lucky accident, it was a way to earn decent money, be relatively cosmopolitan but still stay in a role of servitude. These were Jim Crow days in the US, a bad time, a time of canker. So depicting the necessary black man in this film was handled with some sensitivity. The British filmmakers followed the form of polite deference, but with less bowing and scraping than in an America movie of the era.   But check out who plays the black porter. He's George Muse, perhaps the least servile black man in the business at the time, someone who would go on to earn a doctorate. Someone who refused to give an inch on basic respect. I think the Brits in charge of production, who did the US portions in California with DC projected on screens behind, would have been amused. The savior of the world, with this huge blot.  Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
1,"I have read the short story by Norman Maclean, and the movie did justice to Norman Maclean's writing. My husband tends to reread it occasionally, and I myself have read it over and scenes of the movie keeps coming to mind. We have videos of many of Redford s movies and we have watched ""A River runs through it"" many times. Redford is part of the ""famdamily"" as he is always around. We never get tired of Redford's perception of Norman Maclean writings, and the beauty of Montana. The script reminds me very much of my own upbringing as my father had the same calling as Mr. Maclean's father. According to ""A River Runs Through It,"" ""Methodists are Baptists who can read,"" a line which by the way is not in the short story, but I think that is a funny line! My husband and I are well-read Baptists!  I have heard a movie critic state that the pace of this movie is too slow. I disagree. As one search for inner peace, this is the type of movie that will make you contemplate the beauty of nature in three/four rhythm of the metronome. The photography is outstanding! The acting is great. I love the scene where Norman and Paul as boys talked and wondered whether one could be a fly fisher or a boxer! Then as adult Paul played by Brad Pitt (Se7ven) is the ""perfect guy"" who needs help with his alcoholism but will not accept it. The same applies to Neal Burns, who uses worms as bait, he also needed help but would not accept the fact that he needed help. The scene where Paul refuses to eat oatmeal and the entire family has to wait an eternity to say grace! Finally after hours, they all kneel around the table to say: ""Grace!"" and they all leave. But the oatmeal stayed on the plate! That scene where the two love birds and their tattoos on their posteriors! That is funny! The sunburn! The drive back home where Jessie Burns (Emily Lloyd) decides to go via the train line! Beautiful dialogue when Norman proposes to Jessie because he wants her to come to Chicago with him!  Redford himself does a superb job as a narrator. I could not stop myself from comparing Brad to the young Redford (Barefoot in the Park). The nominated Director, Producer, Actor, is a visionary who deserves to be praised for his advancement not only in the cinema in the US but around the world. I am glad to live in nineteen hundred because I have seen the beginning of the black and white television, the movies and all the technology and special effects, to be able to watch videos at home and to live in the same century as Redford because I have had the chance to see his works. Redford needs no special effects to show us the beauty of Montana in this masterpiece. The river to me means that line that separates life from death, memories and realities. Redford shows the hands of the Creator so magnificently and a river runs through it."
2,"I just wish that there were more amazingly addictive ghetto/drug dramas these days.  All of the idiots who gave this movie bad reviews are full of crap because this movie completely owns.   Whoever said that this movie has a crappy script or is not believable is a total moron, because this movie is epic.  Also they do not use the ""f"" word too much. If anything uses the ""f"" word to much it is the south park movie. (but that is a good movie anyway)  GO SEE IT!"
1,"The creators of south park in their own film here, this is a brilliant film with a huge entertainment factor. If you like Naked Gun films and are not young and not too mature or serious on your humor, you'll love this."
2,"I saw this here in my home town last night, and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. I hadn't been expecting much, to be honest (the trailer does the film a disservice), but I was really taken with what they did, considering they had to make it on a smaller-than-intended budget (no WETA Digital/Industrial Light & Magic, folks). The story was very compelling and it had some great performances, including Jim Caviezel as the hero. Mr. Caviezel was excellent, and I wish we saw more of him, he's like a rock in this picture. But the rest of the cast are every bit as good: Sophia Myles, John Hurt, Jack Huston  brilliant! The trailer did something of an injustice to the cinematographer Pierre Gill, with it looking rougher than the badger's proverbial. This bears no relation to the finished product, which is so beautiful as to be jaw-dropping, and then some. And, while SPIN VFX is no WETA or ILM, their work was great enough that I didn't miss them (although the baby Moorwen wasn't as good as the big one). All told, it was a great film that is much better than the crummy marketing and support would suggest. Give it a go and, on this score, I can't wait to see what all you guys do next!"
2,"""No Good Deed"" is a way-above-average character driven thriller. The fact that it is based on short story by Dashiell Hammett puts in a class above the rest with a story-line that is frighteningly plausible. Boasting a stellar cast including Samuel L Jackson, Stellan Skasgaard and Milla Jovovich it is highly suspenseful with a cracking script. Stellan Skasgaard delivers his lines with relish and Milla Jovovich is highly believable in her role as a woman who plays all the men against each other. Grace Zabriskie and Joss Ackland steal the show, however, with their portrayals of a thief-couple in their twilight years. All, in all, highly recommended for a nights entertainment for those who like their thrillers a little more cerebral than the norm."
2,"Oh my god - I've lost my faith in Steven Seagal. He's horrible.  This movie is absolute junk. The story was lame - there's absolutely zero excitement to the movie. And Seagal doesn't even fight in this movie, I mean c'mon.. what is that? They just show somebody's hand and after that they show Seagals face. It looks stupid and not real at all.  Besides the story is so goddamn crappy and unbelievable anyways. The story is based on the ""fact"" that these guys are going to steal plutonium from a nuclear disposal center or something. The thing just is that you can't make a nuke from plutonium like that - the plutonium has to be enriched first in some weapons facility. Regular plutonium is something like 5% strong - the plutonium used in nukes is 80% stuff. You just don't steal stuff like that - especially NOT IN A LUNCH CUP as they did in the movie.  Don't buy this movie. I spent my money on nothing."
0,"Former private eye-turned-security guard ditches his latest droning job and is immediately offered a chance to return to his previous profession. His assignment: to tail a mysterious French woman newly arrived in California...and apparently wanted by suit-and-tie racketeers. Unsuccessful attempt to update the film noir genre, without enough sting or wit (or involving plot dynamics) in the screenplay. Director and co-scenarist Paul Magwood (who later claimed the picture was edited without his involvement) doesn't give off the impression of having high regard for the '40s films his ""Chandler"" was borne from; his nostalgia is appropriately rumpled, but also bitter-tinged and somewhat indifferent. The handling is curiously, commendably low-keyed, and Warren Oates is well-cast as this '70s variant on the 'private dick' archetype, but the movie doesn't have any snap. Nice to see Leslie Caron and Gloria Grahame in the cast--though neither has much to do, and Caron's hot-and-cold running character is exasperating throughout. Vivid cinematography by Alan Stensvold, nice location shooting, but it fails to come to any kind of a boil. *1/2 from ****"

2,"Unless you like movies about rowing, this movie is a little slow. The only thing this film has in common with Chariots of Fire is the fact that its a period piece. The film is predictable even if you never heard of Ned Hanlan. It's a little ""sappy"" at times. The acting is a bit over the top and wooden with little chemistry felt between Cage and Dale.   SPOILER The training scene for the race on the Thames looked like it was stolen from one of the ""Rocky"" films but without the speed bag. If you like to be bored to tears or need a non-narcotic to fall asleep this would be a good film for you.   ** out of *****"
2,"Out of all of the Studio Ghibli films this World War II animation is my favourite. Set in Japan during the Second World War the story follows Seita and his little sister Setsuko as they survive in a harsh war torn nation in which food and luxuries are short due to wartime efforts.  As the narrative progresses the emotional strain of the war is apparent in the way the plot flows. The emotional bond between the brother and sister and the sheer effort of survival.  As the film reached it's climax I began to shed tears. Some films move you but Grave of the fireflies simply shatters your hope and well being. As you sympathise with the characters their deteriating condition simply tears away at you emotional strings.  The animation is a gritty realism, rather different from the standard principles of animation in which exaggeration is almost necessary to translate emotion to the viewer. But Grave of the fireflies is done so well that even with realistic animation the emotion of the scene translates to the audience.  For those of you who haven't seen this film I truly envy you. Because you get the opportunity to watch one of the greatest films of all time for the first time, an experience I wish I could relive."
1,"by saying that,I mean that this is not a well made movie but it's a very good version of the real event and the best depiction so far.and if you are a WW2 buff then this is a treat for you,cause there are three out of four saboteur members playing roles in this movie. It's theater acting at best but then this is still as said before a semi documentary.  Me personally am a die hard fan of our nearly over-human heroes of the second world war,and there should be hundreds of these movies showing us what they did so it won't get forgotten by next generations.Cause nowadays kids doesn't read books,they watch movies.  So if you want a action extravaganza,rent Private Ryan,this is the truth about lingering pain,outrageous endurance and the will to fight when all seems lost."
0,"Well, there you have it, another disillusion on my account. Two, actually! First of all, even though I like to think of myself that I know a little something about 70's euro-exploitation and its most prolific contributors, I never heard about Joseph W. Sarno before. Here's a guy who made over seventy rancid and cult-laden exploitation movies and I haven't seen a single one! How? Why? What happened here? Secondly, and even worse, just when you think to have found a new source for obscure cult movies, that director's most famous and supposed ""masterpiece"" turns out to be an irredeemably dull and irritating film. Admittedly, lesbian vampire movies form a pretty insignificant sub genre as a whole, but some of them bath in ominous atmosphere and curious sensuality (like José Larraz' ""Vampyres"" or Harry Kümmel's ""Daughters of Darkness""). Joseph Sarno's film has nothing to offer, except copious amounts of gratuitous nudity and even that becomes boring rather quickly. The events take place in a secluded old castle, hidden deep in the German mountains, where five centuries ago lived a malicious and bloodthirsty (literally) baroness. Her loyal disciples still throw naked dance parties in the castle's catacombs, which are lit by penis-shaped candlesAUCH, and hope to resurrect the baroness any time soon now. Suddenly (don't even ask how) the castle is full of young and sexy female guests, so even more erotic rites ensue. Sounds delicious and entertaining enough, but ""The Devil's Plaything"" contains a massive number of sequences where literally nothing happens and where the cast members' ignorant facial expressions are simply unendurable! Sarno isn't capable of creating suspense or building a Gothic atmosphere (or maybe he just didn't bother to) and the actresses' capacities restrict themselves to standing in front the camera topless and pull a really pathetic face. Please do yourself a favor: no matter how desperately you strive to see all lurid lesbian-vampire movies of the 70's, this one isn't worth a penny! Even the repertoires of Jess Franco and Jean Rollin are pure art compared to this dud."
0,"I can't believe we watched this total piece of crap but we did and I feel obligated to warn others to avoid it at all costs. When one of the main characters announces that he's gay twice in the first five minutes, don't ignore it as typical PC nonsense and figure it has to get better because it won't. If his faggoty boyfriend hanging all over him doesn't make you sick, then be thankful the freak who wrote and/or directed this grossout is somehow attempting a little restraint. I mean, get real. It's one thing for there to be a gay character appearing in a movie in such screwed up times as these but quite another to have it continually slapped on the screen and examined up close and personal when the the liner notes clearly state the flick's supposed to be about a mother seeking some sort of ""closure"" over the sudden death of her daughter. What does one thing have to do with the other, one might be tempted to ask? Apparently, the two issues are inextricably interwoven. And if that weren't bad enough, there's the bearded lady at the ice cream parlor. I mean, seriously, hasn't that poor woman ever heard of electrolysis? Why must she go around like that? At the very least, how about shaving the ugly thing off, and while you're at it, have those horrible moles removed, too. Would YOU slurp up some ice cream she just served you? I think not. It must be a New Jersey thing.   You'd think Diane Keaton might save this piece of drek, but think again. Was she actually trying to put lipstick on a corpse? I don't even wanna think about it. So what if the body was supposed to be that of her own dead daughter. This grotesque excuse for cinema is slop from the word go and that's all there is to it. One wishes that each of these characters would simply walk out into the waves and just keep going. None of these flaky people even remotely gain our sympathy for an instant. Trust me -- pass this piece of crap up. It's not about death, a mother who inadvertently suffocated her daughter, or even the other much more unsavory issues it keeps bringing up no matter how little you want to hear it. It's a load of perverted trash from a misguided and talentless director."
2,"When I was 9 years old someone brought over this movie and we watched it. I sat through the entire thing.  At the end the credits rolled up and in my innocent 9-year old voice, I proclaimed that this was the 'Worst Movie Ever Made!'  I am now 17 I have never seen the movie again I stand by that assessment.  Stupid, poorly acted, poorly directed, destroyed a reasonable book Highly unrecommended"
2,"You know, I don't even hate Pauly Shore nearly as much as many other people seem to, and it's still hard to remain objective during the course of this movie and actually judge it for what it's worth. Well, let me get to what I thought it was going to be.  My girlfriend and I were cruising the rental place having just returned Team America and Party Monster. I saw it on the shelf and had looked at it before, but never had the guts to rent it. So we did. We returned home, threw it in, and I started it expecting some sort of funny, dark prank where Shore went around getting interviews from famous actors and comedians about their opinions of the 'late' Pauly Shore. That would have been funny. But I can't judge the movie on my own disappointment from that aspect. This is what you actually get.  Pauly. Shore. Writing.  Yeah, that's it, let it sink in. Absorb it. It's just about as painful as it sounds. There are some decent parts, I'll give him credit for what he wrote that actually did turn out funny, but it's funny for all the wrong reasons. Your reactions might sound like, ""holy hell, he actually got Tom Siezmore/Micheal Madsen/Ben Stiller/Carrot Top to do this for him?"" Those parts are funny enough, but the parts with the maddened redneck and Shore undercover get just plain embarrassing. Too much of the movie is written and the acting contrasts by being half-assed by everybody but Pauly and his mother Mitzi on the phone.  The writing isn't the only bad part, though, the whole thing is done on digital film because (educated guess) it's cheaper. It just looks bad when it's not done right, and he didn't do it right. Most of the movie looks rather like a bunch of giddy little high school girls doing a project for the lit. class. Just bad choices, bad direction, really rough editing, so many things that chop away at the score.  Pauly Shore claims to have worked on this for over four years. The man needs to get a life. Buuuuuuuuuuuddy."
0,"I sought out a copy of The Forest because I was watching a VH1 special, I think ""Where Are They Now"", and saw the video box flash across the screen during a segment on the actor Corky Pigeon. He played the male child ghost in this B horror horrible, but I remember him from his character Freddy on the Silver Spoons television show. This flick's a major letdown. There's nothing here. It actually took me four months to watch it from start to finish. I kept stopping it in boredom, setting it aside and forgetting about it, then stumbling on it and trying once again to get through it. Obviously, the angle of this film that was intended to set it apart from its counterparts was the supernatural element, the apparitions. And obviously, here, that doesn't work. I can't stand the male leads. I kept expecting them to look down at their palms during the longer dialogue scenes in order to read cheat lines. The situation at the beginning where the couples decide to go camping separately is awkward and plain dumb. I guess the only positive thing to say about this one is the scene where the guy falls and breaks his leg, you can see the bone sticking out of his flesh. It's fairly good gore makeup there. Man, I'm really reaching for a positive now, huh. The only other no-budget horror film on a level as bad as this one would be Home Sweet Home."
2,"a movie with real heart that WILL NOT make you feel icky for liking that characters. Melba and Dottie are better people (and therefore better characters) than most down and outs in movies these days. The movie has a stunning lack of agenda - which is meant as a compliment in that it's emotional payoffs are earned and natural as opposed to being sickly or cynical. Bravo! Why can't they make sequels to little films with epic themes - this plays as a sort of Odyessy trailer park style. Plus, lets give the casting some points for inspiration. I know this movie is coming out on DVD soon, so everybody look out for it - it's a keeper."
2,"Wow is the only thing I can say about this movie. There never was and will never be anything like it. It is the only movie that I watched more than 20 times, sometimes twice in a row. It is the best movie on the planet! I think that Thora Birch is the only one who could play Enid because nobody else would be that convincing. Every single time I watch this movie I discover something new and that is why I keep watching it. If there are original movies left in this world, then one of them should definitely be Ghost World. Now, I could keep talking about this for hours and still I would have to say more. The best way to find out what I'm talking about is to watch it."
0,"I'll start with what I liked.  I really liked the songs, everything about them was great, the costumes, music, lyrics (as long as the translation was good :) ), choreography, everything.  I loved the crab scene and the cooking scene.  But that's about it.  I get it, arty cinema, blablabla, but too much is too much. Too much silence (it was interesting for an hour, but two hours of hearing steps and moaning from time to time, really...), too much boredom (no movie should ever be boring, no matter how deep it was to be!), too much porn-like scenes (I do get it really, I get that they were filming a porn movie there, but really, REALLY, really that is too much) I truly think, that cinema should be for watching and this one is definitely not watchable in no way.  3 stars for the songs."
2,"There are times that this feels like a TV Movie. In fact, if it were not for the presence of James Woods that is all this would be, a good TV movie. As it is, Woods acts his socks off without overdoing it. He manages to pull this up to a much higher standard, very watchable stuff, in fact. There is nothing really ground shaking in the script and, to be truthful, it kind of gets a bit lost at a couple of points. Like others have pointed out, the dark twisted aspect of the original book do not quite come across to the screen, but nevertheless is a very passable transition. In summary, not one to watch for your main film on a Saturday night, but certainly worth a look on any other night."
1,"Takashi Miike is one of my favorite directors and I was worried about him doing a kids film, because I would hate to see him depart from his films I came to love: Visitor Q, Gozu, Izo, Ichi the killer and Black Socioty Trilogy. Lately he seems to be exploring new territory and I think he's succeeding. Still this was the first of his films I'd seen him take that direction, so I was nervous. Of coarse I bought it without seeing it and was glad I did.  Great Yokai War is a perfect kids film and adults should like it too. The whole film reminded me so much of the movies I loved as a child: Neverending story, Labyrinth, Return to Oz, etc. I enjoyed those films because they didn't treat kids like they're stupid and this one doesn't either. The dark underlying morals are there, but, it's also as silly as any kids film should be. I personally wasn't bothered by the CGI and prosthetics. I feel like they fit well and don't think kids will notice.  If you are a die hard Takashi Miike fan, you may not like this one. But, I suggest giving it a shot. It proves that Miike is as diverse and talented as I suspected he is. He also continues to make his signature Miike films outside of these ones, which is very reassuring.  To those people that are new to Takashi Miike and want something light hearted or dramatic like this one, I suggest these other Miike films: 'Zebraman' 'The Happiness of the Katakuris' 'Sabu' and 'The Bird People in China.'   Good job Takashi Miike! 8/10 stars."
1,"If only ALL animation was this great. This film is classic because it is strong is two simple aspects: Story and Character. The characters in this film are beautifully personified. I felt for all of the characters, and human-animal relationship in the movie works perfectly. The beautiful animation and 3-D computer animation hasn't worked better in any other film. This is a great movie for kids, and for adults who want a classic hero's journey. 8 of 10."
2,"I believe some of the negative comments on this film may be do to people not familiar with the comic strip. I grew up with this comic strip and enjoyed the film very much. Daisy mae was one of my first screen sweethearts. The singing voice of Daisy Mae was Imogene Lynn, a not well known singer except in the musical crowd. I thought the song about politicians in Washington is still valid today. The plot maybe a little corny but it was able to incorporate the little aspects of the comic strip that us old timers are familiar with. Russ"
0,"His first movie after longtime friend John Belushi's death, Aykroyd shows much fatigue trying to pull off a character that would have been a snap for Belushi.  Instead, ""Doctor Detroit"" gives us bookish professor Aykroyd masquerading as a weird, violent pimp to ward off a rival known only as Mom. That's bad enough, but he also has classes to teach, a school dinner to host, four ladies of the evening to protect and a Pimp's Dinner (or something like that) to attend. No wonder Aykroyd seems stupefied most of the time. Why should the viewer be alone?  It was on this film that Aykroyd met future wife Donna Dixon. At least some good came out of this chaotic mess.  One and a half stars. You want good Aykroyd, see ""The Blues Brothers"". You want bad, see ""Doctor Detroit""."
1,"Yes its an art... to successfully make a slow paced thriller.  The story unfolds in nice volumes while you don't even notice it happening.  Fine performance by Robin Williams. The sexuality angles in the film can seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the film. However, the core plot is very engaging. The movie doesn't rush onto you and still grips you enough to keep you wondering. The direction is good. Use of lights to achieve desired affects of suspense and unexpectedness is good.  Very nice 1 time watch if you are looking to lay back and hear a thrilling short story!"
1,"my name is Heather and i am the girl whose story this movie was based on. I want to thank all of you who saw this movie and enjoyed it. as crude and harsh as some of the things that were depicted in this movie were, it didn't really even come close to describing how bad things actually were. not to mention the affect everything had on my mother and little sister. thanks once again for the great comments that everyone had,i truly appreciate them  Hi everyone!  This is Heather's mom. It's hard to believe that so many years have gone by since this movie was made. Harder even to believe that people were still watching it a year ago. For any of you out there who have gone thru the same or similar kind of situation, please know that there are people out here in cyberspace that do understand completely how you feel. Our thoughts and prayers are with each and every one of you."
2,"One of the greatest casts ever assembled help this, otherwise turgid, melodrama to chug along for over two and a half hours, (three, if you are unlucky enough to catch the US video version), but they still can't manage to lift it above the level of a second rate television movie. All the more disappointing considering the plot has all the ingredients of good drama and is based on a true story.  In 1939 a ship load of 937 German Jews set sail from Hamburg to Cuba only to be refused entry. It is a tragedy of epic proportions reduced to something of a travesty by a lack-lustre script and a mediocre director out of his depth, (Stuart Rosenberg; ""Cool Hand Luke"" was a fluke). The cast rise above the material whenever they can. Some, such as Julie Harris, James Mason and Wendy Hiller, don't have enough to do. Others excel. Max Von Sydow seems incapable of giving a bad performance and Oskar Werner, virtually reprising his role in ""Ship of Fools"", is superb as always. Orson Welles pops up as a corrupt and corpulent official and steals every scene he's in. Faye Dunaway pouts and Lee Grant's histrionics won her an Oscar nomination. There is also an awful lot of shouting and screaming."
2,"well well well. i've got the brand new DVD release of this flick last Christmas, i've where thrilled to see that there was a giant white shark on the cover but in the movie it is a small tiger shark...duh. when i started to watch it looked kinda interesting but later on...uh, this is the most boring shark flick ever!. it contains 2 hour of 2 guys hitting of girls, and maybe 3-4 shots of the shark attacks. it was a huge disappointment - this is a warning: if you love shark movies don't watch this one it is more like a soft porn flick more than a horror flick - take on better films like Jaws or even the cult classic The Last Shark. i don't recommend this one. stay away !! 1/10"
2,"I felt so moved after watching this film. Steve McQueen did a terrific job acting as Henry. Although at times, he just acted as McQueen, he did a wonderful job expressing suffering in the solitary confinement scene, and great towards the end of the movie. Hoffman is always an exceptional actor and in this movie he is no different. Unfortunately it neither won for, nor got nominated for an Oscar, and it deserved to win 3 (supporting actor, actor, picture). As much as I loved the Sting, this movie was better for that year.Some critics gave it a bad review, even a 1973 Roger Ebert article criticized this film. I guess you cant blame them too much, movies were better those days. Note that 1973 was sandwiched between 2 Godfather years.Maybe some people figured that McQueen was just redoing his Great Escape role. Either way, nowadays films are so bad I am just thirsting for a movie this deep. But if the best Hollywood can do nowadays is a glittzy trashpiece like Chicago, we cant expect too much from our times."
1,"This movie is so cheap, it's endearing!!! With Ron Liebmann (Major Vaughn) providing the most entertaining on-screen diatribes in film history. I own 2 copies of this movie on video...on one, Ralph Macchio is caught actually cracking up in the background at Major Vaugn while he is ranting at ""Hash"". Obviously they forgot to edit this mistake out of the film, but it goes to show just how funny the movie is, when the actors themselves can't keep a straight face!!!"
1,"I love All Dogs Go to Heaven even though I'm a guy. This and The Land Before Time are the best animated films that Don Bluth has made! In the movie Gharlie Barkin (Burt Reynolds) is helped by his friend Itchy (Dom DeLuise) freedom out of the pound in New Orleans 1939. Charlie who's in casino business wants to share equal with his partner Carface (Vic Tayback). Carface who is unwilling to share the equal with Charlie pushes a car on a bridge onto Charlie killing him! Charlie enters heaven and meets Annabelle (Melba Moore) who shows Charlie that his time is up by showing him a watch that has stopped and she explains that All Dogs Go to Heaven because all dogs are naturally good! Charlie hides the stop watch behind his back and switches it back and he returns to Earth alive with Annabelle screaming You can never come back! Charlie reunites with Itchy and they go and explore soon to find out that Carface has not only attempted to murder Charlie he has also kidnapped a little orphan Girl named Ann Marie (Judith Barsi). When Carface leaves Charlie and Itchy help Ann Marie escape. The next day Charlie Itchy and Ann Marie go to look for money! Ann Marie sees a couple who she thinks would make great parents for her! While Ann Marie talks to the couple Charlie sneaks up behind the man and steals his wallet! Charlie Ann Marie and Itchy then go to a horse race where they bet the man's money that a horse will win the race! The horse they said would win winds up winning and Charlie, Itchy, and Ann Marie are payed $1,000 for the bet! Charlie promises Ann Marie he'll use the money to give to the poor but winds up buying a new casino and gambling and buys pizza for his friend Flo (Loni Anderson) and her puppies. Soon Ann Marie has found out that Charlie had stolen the wallet from the man and used his money on the horse race and everything! Charlie sad about this has a dream about going to Hell and the Devil! Soon Charlie awakens and finds out that Ann Marie is gone! She has left to give the wallet back to the couple who forgive her about the wallet and invite her to breakfast! Charlie asks Ann Marie to leave with him and she does pretending to be sick but are captured by mice who try to feed them to King Gator but they manage to escape! Soon Carface shows up and captures Ann Marie. He plans to drown her but Charlie comes to the rescue and calls on King Gator who eats Carface. Charlie's time is up and he must die again. Itchy with the help of the other dogs finds the couple who took Ann Marie in and get them to come with them to where Ann Marie is. They are there in time to save Ann Marie but are too late to save Charlie who's time has ended! Charlie who is awarded for his heroic effort for saving Ann Marie is welcomed back to Heaven but before he enters he says good-bye to Ann Marie who has been adopted by the couple and asks her to take care of Itchy for him. She says yes and tells Charlie she loves him and good-bye! Charlie enters Heaven again as it's said All Dogs Go to Heaven! Filled with wonderful animation, characters, and story Don Bluth has proved to us again that he is a good animator! It's too bad this movie was release the same year Little Mermaid which is my favorite Disney movie! They both came out in 1989 which was the year before I was born! I guess I'll have to call them both the Best Animated Features of 1989! 10 out of 10!"
2,"I loved this movie as a kid. It's a great suspenseful, spooky movie without any gore because of the time period it was made in.   Back then they had to rely on a plot to get the audiences attention.  I am desperate to buy this movie on DVD.  I hope someday someone will put it on DVD.  It's a treasure that should not be lost.  If anyone comes across source we can buy this from, I hope they will post it to let us all know.  At this point I have to fill in the 10 lines of text this thing says I have to have to post a comment :-("
2,"What a great collection of a great band, but you have to FF through anything Gary Cherone is on, it's just a terrible era that so many of us true fans wish would have never happened. If you can get your hands on a used copy, I'd recommend it, certainly not worth the retail price they ask for in stores."
1,"That was definitely the case with Angels in the Outfield. It was on TV last night and I believe I hadn't seen the film since my sophomore year in high school and I'm now in my 4th year of college. Although the film has many flaws, it is just so touching that you can't help but sit down, watch it, and enjoy yourself. It is also hilarious. Danny Glover's ranting is just so over the top that you can't help but laugh out loud at him at most time. It adds to the film and I'm sure it's exactly what the director wanted. You actually feel for the characters in the film even though the development isn't the best. A must see. I highly recommend.  8/10"
2,"In Chicago, Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) and her friend Bernadette Walsh (Kasi Lemmons) are researching for their thesis about urban legend in the University of Illinois, where Helen's husband Trevor Lyle (Xander Berkeley) gives classes. Helen becomes obsessed by the legend of the Candyman (Tony Todd), a son of slaves whose father became rich in 1890 after inventing a device for mass producing of shoes. The educated Candyman was an artist, but when the daughter of a powerful man got pregnant of him, her father hired some hooligans that saw off his right hand with a rusty blade, took him to an apiary with dozens of hives with hungry bees, smashed the hives and smeared honeycomb in his naked body. Candyman was stung to death by the bees, than his body was burnt in a giant pyre and the ashes scattered on Cabrini Green. Candyman stays alive in the legend that says that he would appear if his name is spoken five times in front of the mirror, and the skeptical Helen summons Candyman. Helen and Bernadette go to Cabrini Green, where two unsolved murders had happened, and the dwellers blame Candyman for the crimes. Helen's disbelief brings Candyman back; the dog of Cabrini Green's dweller Anne-Marie McCoy (Vanessa Williams) is slashed and her baby vanishes, and Helen is blamed. Later Candyman kills her friend Bernadette, and Helen is accused of first degree murder and arrested, while she unsuccessfully tries to prove that Candyman is the real killer.  ""Candyman"" is a gore and well-developed horror movie with a character visibly inspired in the urban legend of Bloody Mary. The screenplay sustains the ambiguity of Helen's sanity, and it is never clear if Candyman does really exist or the murders are committed by the disturbed and impressed Helen. Virginia Madsen is excellent in her performance of a woman in the edge of insanity and Tony Todd is amazing with his strong and dark voice. The great music score of Philip Glass fits perfectly to the movie and is another plus. My vote is seven.  Title (Brazil): ""O Mistério de Candyman"" (""The Mystery of Candyman"")"
2,"I went with trepidations, figuring Tilda Swinton would be wonderful and the rest would be so-so. I was delighted to be wrong. The movie really hinges on the four children, they are the center. I thought it was extremely well-cast and acted. I can't remember the actors names but Lucy is enchanting, Peter is noble, Susan is a difficult role as the practical, spoil-sport so I can't say she was marvelous, but really Edmund is where everything revolves.  This Edmund was really great. I was able to care about him and hope for him in a way I never did in the book. Kudos to the kids.  In the book, Mr. Tumnus was pivotal, even if briefly seen, and the movie's Mr. Tumnus was delightfully sweet and touching. There's a special scene between he and Lucy that is inventive and wonderful.  Aslan - impossible really to capture as he is a concept. I felt the facial expression was so true to the sense of sorrow that Aslan carries but I was not fond of Liam Neesan's voice. Somehow that did not work for me, nor did the voice of the wolf.  But Aslan does convey goodness and it's transitory nature and the end brought that home so well. While many seem to believe this is a Christian-themed movie, I think whatever you believe will work because the themes of good and evil, nobility and sacrifice are universal and symbolic.  A beautiful movie that I highly recommend to those who love adventure, fantasy and myth."
2,"Which is why I rented it. An OK movie about a cop who ""goes outside the rules"" to track what he suspects is a serial killer. Like other reviewers, I laughed at stuff that was probably not supposed to be amusing just because Woods was so damn funny. He plays a fairly sleazy guy, which is what he does best. Charles Durning is also very good, as is Lesley Ann Warren, though I just wanted to slap her character a couple of times for being so stupid and whiny. The sudden, no BS ending is awesome--I love it when movies end with an abrupt blackout like that, and he gets a great ending line. I played the ending back a few times it was so cool and bada$$. This movie was actually surprisingly disturbing in parts, there's a really gruesome scene where Wood's character (I can't remember the cop's name, it was probably Jake or Jack or something snarky like that)finds a murder victim about 3/4 of the way through the film that really shocked me and gave me the creeps. Anyway, a good underrated film with a kick-a$$ ending."
2,"To be honest I cannot elaborate on this one, as I only saw the first half hour of the movie. Comédia de Deus for me is the only movie that I ever ran away from, after some short debating with my two companions, leaving the other two spectators the cinema to themselves (I still sometimes wonder whether they managed to sit it out). The first half hour (fair is fair) is the most bewildering piece of fiction I ever saw, combining the utter idiocy of, say, the Police Academy series with the astounding 'la-di-dah, oh, what great art I'm making'-attitude of films as ""Ulysses's Gaze"".  Worst first half hour ever, but hey, maybe the rest was good. Go check yourself, though, because I've seen the last of this one."
1,"I loved this film. Not being a swooning Ed Wood Jr. fan, I prefer to appreciate his ""boundless enthusiasm"" and acknowledge his shortcomings. His movies are fun, but his personal story is one racked with pain. I hoped, and was delighted to find, that this film would be about understanding his turbulent life, rather than simply heaping him with posthumous praise. From beginning to end, this film evolves from a documentary into a mythology, leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and to Ed Wood Jr.  What we get are people who knew Ed Wood the best talking about him from all perspectives, positive and negative, and showing us their character as much as Ed's. We get insight into Ed's personal and professional life: from his romances, to his drinking, to his sexuality, to his friends, to his enemies, and even to his film making.  The film itself is shot in a low-budget way that seems done out of respect for Ed, as if using the techniques of most theatrically released movies from 1996 would be disrespectful (sort of like wearing a nicer suit than the President). The set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their background.  Fans will be excited to hear personal testimony regarding Ed Wood controversies, and new comers will be amazed that this man was real. The DVD is full of impossible to find gems (""Crossroads of Lorado"" and photo galleries), but the real treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and interconnected story.  Ed Wood had a habit of defining people through their association with him (for better or worse), to the point where one woman will go down in history as ""Swimming Pool Owner"" for once letting him and his friends be baptized in her pool. This ability to define a person's legacy comes through universally, as the most amazing effect of the film is to not only give a well rounded idea of the man that was Ed Wood Jr., but also to give a comprehensive view of the community that he created. Somehow, without ever having more that one cast member being interviewed on screen at a time, the connection that Ed Wood created amongst the various people in his life becomes clear, and the viewer is left with great sense of involvement.  Even the title hints at the B-list horror genre, but by the end, we see that even this is a kindness. What begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that all of the cast will be forever weaved into an unpredictably cohesive fabric that history will bring into haunting unity with Wood's legend.  In many ways a living contradiction, Ed Wood Jr. could not be condensed to a single viewpoint. This collaborative effort is the closest to knowing him that we can ever get. Being itself a juxtaposition of themes, it is at once respectful, provocative, thoughtful, gripping, fun, sad, kind, and fulfilling."
2,"It sure took a long time for this film to debut here, and if memory serves me right, it took almost a year, and the DVD has already been released. If not for a press screening already held, I would have thought that the film would be one of those that are difficult to pass by the censors and required some lengthy debate as to the merits for its theatrical release. That's because it deals with the current topic of terrorism in an unflinching manner, with the hijacking of religion to further the terrorists' extremist and violent ends being told in a style yet unseen from films such as The Kingdom, Syriana, The Siege and Body of Lies, to name but a few films dealing with the topic.  I am a keen admirer of Don Cheadle's film performance, especially in dramatic roles, and here he plays Samir Horn, a devout Muslim and US citizen caught up in a web of intrigue and international terrorism acts. We see how he employs his skills of bomb-making, honed from his US Special Operations days as an officer, and seemingly looks like a rogue, US domestic terrorist aiding foreign groups in their operations to harm the world. But there's more than meets the eye to Samir, and here's where Cheadle excels in putting that level of ambiguity into a role that raises moral questions about doing something for the ""greater good"", no matter the costs.  Chasing him around the world are FBI counter-terrorism agents Roy Clayton (Guy Pearce) and Max Archer (Neal McDonough), who are clearly like fish out of water when operating outside their legal jurisdictions. Unfortunately for the two actors, their roles here as the downright good guys are always a step or two behind the terrorist cells, which in some ways mirror that in real life. Without good intelligence, you're always reactive, and it takes a lot to be on top of the game, especially when tactics employed are normally innovately discharged. We get to see a number of ""no-brainer"" tactics that the cells employ which are effective if you think about it, which makes it all the more dangerous should they be used because they actually can be.  But the most dangerous game to be playing from the side of the good guys, is the refusal to share intelligence or to combine resource, drawing lines in the sand and setting up turfs. The bickering between agencies all point to missing out on the bigger picture on one hand, while on the other the need for confidentiality also brings up operational sensitivity in order not to jeopardize any current missions, and this need to know service also stems from being overly cautious of any internal moles that would betray efforts in progress. In some ways, this is like Infernal Affairs being played all over again.  I suppose that without the balanced view and very verbatim statements made toward the end renouncing violence and misguided teachings, this film would probably not be given the green light. But it did, and presented a very though provoking thinking man's action thriller set in this age of cloak and dagger terrorism. Sure it has some loopholes and the unnecessary (and unavoidable) collateral damage, but watch this for the performance all round and an engaging storyline that might not keep you guessing all the way once the cat is out of the bag, but does enough."
2,"I read the book back when I was in college. It was trash but it was GOOD trash. It involves a happy family--a mom, a dad and four kids. The father dies and the mother rapidly runs out of money. She has no choice to ask her parents (who disapproved of the marriage) for help. Her mother agrees but tells her that her children must stay up in the attic--her father doesn't know about them and, if he did, he wouldn't help her. The kids are in the attic for THREE YEARS. And, over time, one of the brothers ""discovers"" his sister...and the grandmother tortures them almost daily. Those were the big selling points of the book...the incest and kids being tortured. It does have a happy ending though (sort of).  I was one of the ""lucky"" ones who actually saw this at a theatre back in 1987. The studio snuck it out quietly--I found out why. First, the story was changed. They wanted a PG-13 rating so there's no incest at all--not even suggested. The tortures their grandmother puts them through were softened or eliminated entirely. They aren't up there for three years. And they completely changed the ending (although it WAS great to see the mother get it at the end). All the changes drained the story of any impact it might have had. Acting didn't help--Louise Fletcher is LOUSY as the evil grandmother; Victoria Tennant was even worse as the mother; Kristy Swanson as the oldest daughter overplayed her role a LOT. Only Jeb Stuart Adams as her brother gave a halfway good performance. It was no great piece of acting but pretty OK.  To be fair to the movie, a faithful adaptation of the book would probably be way too grim for a movie (and get an NC-17 rating) but diluting it completely AND adding lousy acting isn't the way to go! Boring, stupid, illogical...a total waste. This deserves a 0. I'm really surprised that some people LIKE this movie!"
2,"The main character may be a bit boring, but there are some terrific performances by Connery, DeNiro and i even like Garcia, (normally i can't stand the guy). Also great action sequences masterfully directed by DePalma, and some great setpieces. Watch for the dinner-table sequence with DeNiro holding his baseballbat: an instant classic."
2,"Who says you can't beat a dead horse several times over. Watch any slasher movie and you'll see what I mean. How much more gross can you get. Saw,Hostel,Hills Have Eyes,Freddy VS Jason etc, just to name a few.It's all about how many different disgusting,stomach churning ,vile ways you can kill a human being. Cutting off this,chopping off that,cannibalism, guts being ripped out, people being cut in half,eyes cut off or gouged out. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre the Beginning is another tired old retread of the same guy running around with a chainsaw hacking people up. No plot , just get a bunch of kids to run around and find different ways to hack them up. I like Lee Ermey but can't understand why he would do this garbage. He makes for a hot cop but thats about it. Only draw might be to see some hot chicks before they get offed. Otherwise bottom feeder material."
0,"WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS (Not that you should care. Also, sorry for the caps.)  Starting with an unnecessarily dramatic voice that's all the more annoying for talking nonsense, it goes on with nonsense and unnecessary drama. That's badly but accurately put.  We know space travel is a risky enterprise. There's a complicated system with a lot of potential for malfunctions, radiation, stress-related symptoms etc, and unexpected things are bound to happen in largely unknown environments. They knew stuff could go wrong. In fact, stuff had gone wrong. It's called learning. Granted, Appollo 11 wasn't safe by today's standards and there was immense political pressure, but the overall performance of the technology on the mission was impressive.  Assorted mistakes/comments I hadn't even to look up:  1) Nixon prepared a speech in case something went wrong. Well duh. That's what I would've done. It was the apex of a propaganda war, after all.  2) NASA gives green light despite the fact that Appollo 11 will probably blow up. (This is ""only"" implicit, though.) Yeah, that's why they let people and press watch in almost-real-time.  3) The capsule ejection wouldn't work. Like it didn't work the time a chimp was in it. The one that survived? It was a test launch and the rocket exploded, the capsule accelerated away and landed with a parachute. There's a video of it, you can probably find it on youtube or at least look it up somewhere.  4) One interviewed guy says an explosion would have wiped out a fair part of Florida. I can only assume it was meant as a hyperbole, 'cause if not, I'm just aghast how he could get it so wrong.  5) The technology then was primitive compared to today's standards. Actually, relatively primitive software and hardware is used even today, the reason being that it must not crash. It's even worse for spacecraft, because their computers must be built of comparably large components that aren't that susceptible to radiation. (And the craft itself must be pilotable manually anyway, so a complex steering system like the B2's wouldn't do.) What's with the fact that they were using ""TV screens"" rather than ""computer screens""? It's the same damn technology. Actually TV monitors were and are produced with a significantly higher definition.  6) ""If that object wasn't part of the rocket, it could be only one thing."" We see where this is going. Apart from the fact that the statement is wrong, who says it wasn't a rocket part? At least an interviewee clears up that if a thing is flying and you don't know what it is, it's by definition an Unidentified Flying Object.  7) The voice-over as well as some misquotes make it seem as though the lander's radiation foil was actually its hull. Which would make it thinner than a space suit.  8) Neil Armstrong's near death during a practice flight is footage I can appreciate; I hadn't seen it before. As I said, any piece of manifest technology can go wrong, especially if it's not been tested sufficiently on account of being, you know, unprecedented.  9)The trajectory discrepancy of the descending lander (due to irregularities in the Moon's density) was at no time acutely life-threatening. Neither was the ""fifteen seconds of fuel left"", which was, in fact, ""fifteen seconds of fuel left before having to abort the mission and returning to the command module"".  10) A ""catastrophic chain of events"" usually results in catastrophe. I really don't know how to put it any simpler. This, however, is a prime example of the rhetoric used.  11) There's a short sequence of one of the astronauts walking and hopping around aimlessly like a gleeful kid, followed by the voice-over telling us that the reason for this strange behavior ""can now be revealed"". Turns out, he was walking and hopping around aimlessly like a gleeful kid. Hilarious stuff.  12) It's mentioned that during re-entry, all contact was lost. This is a perfectly natural phenomenon and it was as well known at the time as it's impossible to circumvent with contemporary technology. Again, the gravity of this is implicit, but very purposely so.  13) There was never a shuttle lost in space itself, while the voice-over presents this ""fact"" as evidence that Appollo 11 was a pile of crap. Appollo 13 was a near-loss, but the two real disasters happened during liftoff and re-entry, respectively. In any case, comparing shuttles to Saturn rockets is somehow ... well, okay, just plain stupid. Even ignoring that, the successful shuttle missions seem to not have been deemed of interest to the audience.  14) What the hell's up with the UFO? Even in the context of the movie, it makes no sense. Unless you assume it was made for entertainment purposes, aimed at a specific audience (which seems to include people with next to no understanding of either history, science, or rhetorics).  Even the point of the movie is somewhat obscure. Catch-phrases like ""covered up until now"", ""publically revealed here for the first time"", come up, but the film doesn't place any blame or offer a lesson or anything, which could be expected of a film so emotionally done. In the good old tradition of sensationalism, there are numerous interview shots and recording fragments that are often out of context or with people that we know nothing about except ""NASA scientist"". Wow, so the astronauts were very nervous before the endeavor? Fancy that. What does this have to do with the point of the movie again? Oh yeah, which point.  In summary, in addition to being either willfully or incompetently inaccurate, it's not even good entertainment. And believe me, I'm a guy who enjoys his crappy documentaries; this film isn't funny, witty, quaint, it's nothing."
2,"I found this at a Newbury Comics in the used section for under $10. I regret spending this. The only thing this movie has going for it is the creepy music. Plot holes and random behavior in this movie destroy the film. For instance, Rebecca Simmons (that's Simmons, not Falls) is never mentioned throughout the rest of the film, nor is she even credited. Also the kill scenes are also very sub-par and not scary, and the acting and editing was horrendous and haphazard. Worst of all is that many questions are left unanswered. No wonder none of the actors never acted in many films after. The saving grace of this film is the Silver mask the Conscience Killer wears. The best thing this film is for is either a coaster or a cheesy movie night with a couple of friends."
0,"Oh dear god. This was horrible. There is bad, then there was this. This movie makes no sense at all. It runs all over the map and isn't clear about what its saying at all. The music seemed like it was trying to be like Batman. The fact that 'Edison' isn't a real city, takes away. Since I live in Vancouver, watching this movie and recognizing all these places made it unbearable. Why didn't they make it a real city? The only writing that was decent was'Tilman' in which John Heard did a fantastic job. He was the only actor who played his role realistically and not over the top and campy. It was actually a shame to see John Heard play such a great bad guy with a lot of screen time, and the movie be a washout. Too bad. Hopefully someone important will see it, and at least give John Heard credit where credit is due, and hire him as lead bad guy again, which is where he should be. on the A List."
2,"Why was this movie made? No doubt to sucker in the family-rebelling MTV faithful, many of whom do not care about anything other than the exterior of a movie - in Go the story about drugs and sex, and the crude humor. While the plot line of the movie is interesting, the unsympathetic and underdeveloped characters give us nothing to care about.  What is most bothersome is that at the end of the movie nobody learns anything. This movie would have been much better if it had a point. It makes brief and ambivalent references to family life, but never really has the guts to develop its critiques.  I guess what makes this movie so pathetic is that every character is like all the other characters. What's worse, never in the film, not even at the climax, do any characters distinguish themselves. The four men in Vegas hardly differ at all, and the three convenience store workers are all the same. If you want to waste your 7 bucks on uninspiring and forgettable slop, Go is waiting for you."
2,"I didn't really get into this movie until the first car scene, Then things begin to happen and From this moment forward, this movie turns into a pure magical experience you just can't turn away from. Michael J. Fox is at his very best and so is everyone else in this heartwarming film. I found myself wanting to find this enchanting little town full of pure ""down home folks"". It's a very funny film that draws you completely into it. It's about real life, real happiness, and real people. No phonies here. This film will make you think about what life is really about. Watch it once and you will find yourself wanting to watch it over and over again. It's absolutely one of the best films I have seen"
2,"Aaja Nachle is not a typical Yashraj film in the sense of scenery - snow, mountains, etc. But one thing is for sure and that is that this is the return of Madhuri Dixit, whose last film was ""Devdas."" Dia, a dance instructor, who lives in New York, receives a call that her tutor, who lives in the village of Shyamilee, in India, is very ill and has called for her. Upon her return, she is informed that he has passed away and that it was his wish that she tries to save the arts centre in which she, herself, was once a student. She then finds her best friend, Najma, but she refuses to help her.  Directed by Anil Mehta and written by Aditya Chopra, this is a musical genre movie and the songs are memorable, which makes it a change since nowadays, there are only some songs and music that can be hummed to or remembered. The most memorable is the title song itself and off course, with Madhuri Dixit looking so slim and gorgeous, the dances are worth while watching. The cast includes Akshaye Khanna, Konkona Sen, Kunal Kapoor, Vinay Pathak, Divya Dutta and Irfan Khan.  Madhuri Dixit's charm is still there and this movie, for all her fans, is worth watching - this is the return of Madhuri. Yes! It is expected that she will work in movies but not so much as before,"
2,"I've seen thousands of movies over the years, many good, many bad, and some that just make me wish I would've just shoveled snow naked instead. This film was the latter. Yes, it was painful to sit through. Very painful. I really had high hopes for this film. I was looking forward to relaxing to a good nature flick that had some excitement as well. One with a good plot. Forget it here! I kept waiting, and waiting, and waiting, but nothing. There were tons of opportunities too. But nothing. A few things kept going through my head as I watched this movie: 1) Hollywood losers trying to make a point. 2)Bleeding heart liberal conservationist using this as a vehicle, and 3)Chick flick. Not even just a chick flick, but a chick flick written by a chick! Man, I'm still hurting! I hate it when 4,000 babies are being aborted a day in the USA, and yet I'm supposed to cry over a dead rhino which is far more important in their eyes. Yes, many have missed the point in life, especially you Kim. Ok, Basinger still looks good in her upper 40's, and I applaud her at not using tons of facelifts like most of Hollywood past 40, but that's the only reason this film gets a 1/10 from me! Hello folks, there's a reason this film has been given 68 1/10's! Keep reading...From the get go it was lost. A bunch of rich people living in Italy and none seemed to be Italian. They're loser theatre types out drinking and heading to a bar late at night. Hymph, accurate there at least. An accident and it's time for a change. Let's get married and move to Kenya! Hello!! They go from pampered to no running water or A.C., ya, right! On another note, that lead actors accent, it was enough to make me rip my eardrums out! Ugh, please get it out of my head!!! I don't know what country he was from. Kim (Kuki), or Kooky, which is more accurate, is having a hard time adjusting to rough Africa life, but hangs in there. She worries about her husband going out too much with the boys, and danger...he of course dies. The funeral, and Kim's first painful written speech. Her boy grows up, she tells him not to raise poisonous snakes, he gets bit, he dies. Kims second and even more painful funeral poem/speech. Ugh, thankfully I had some pudding to eat and the fast forward button. Kim's Mom keeps flying in to the funerals. It's Eva Marie Saint, and boy, she hasn't aged well at all. In fact, the dead rhino looked better. Sorry Eva. At one point their jeep gets stuck in the mud (of course after Mom warns her) and she steps out into a puddle and wrecks her new gucci's. Ya, gucci's in wild Africa, oh, I forgot, us idiots had to be reminded they were rich socialites from Italy! Oyvay!!! Kim also informs some local tribal chief of poachers killing the poor Elephants and Rhinos..You have to see this guy, man, what poor typecasting! He reminds me of the black guy from Crocodile Dundee II, all cool and suave. My gosh, he's supposed to be a tribal chief living in a 130 degree hut!!! Plus, he's wearing shades and not sweating!! A black guy not sweating in the African heat, give me a break! I really can't go on, man, this film totally stunk! Period! Not even Kim's shirt falling off from behind could save it. Force the director, the lead actors, the casting agent, and all involved to live there for the rest of their lives! Flamio, and I'm out!"
2,"There are two basic problems with this film: First, Rudolph Valentino may have been incredibly sexy on screen (woo-hoo!), but he wasn't that interesting off-screen. Second, he Rudolf Nureyev isn't a good enough actor to make him interesting. Russell tries to work around these basic problems by including lots of 1920's Hollywood excess and decadence, and as much sex and violence as he could fit in, all in amazing period clothes, but it's not enough.  It's a gorgeous film to look at, the screen glitters with light and color and glamour, and some of the scenes are stunning enough to keep you watching. My favorites are the dance sequences, Valentino was a dancer and the slinky, sexy Nureyev does several dazzling tango numbers. (I recommend this film to any serious balletomane for that reason)  It's when he has to talk that the film runs into trouble, and since he's the entire film, it's major trouble. Nureyev's English was never that good, and he either stumbles over his lines or spits them out at top Russian speed. His body is expressive, but his face is not, which is typical of dancers whose faces aren't clearly seen by the audiences, and who are mainly concerned with not panting visibly.  But the problem that could probably never be overcome is that the characters aren't very sympathetic or interesting. Valentino spent his short career as a passive pawn of the studios, his bitch wife Natasha Rambova (snippily played by the bland Michelle Phillips), and diva actor-director Alla Nazimova (Leslie Caron gnawing on the scenery). The script tries to build some regular-Joe-who-never-wanted-to-be-a-star sympathy for him, which somehow makes him less worthy of this kind of attention.  No, Valentino was an astonishing stud on screen and a wuss off, the only compelling thing about him are the performances he left. Better to get a tape of ""The Sheik"" than to watch this.  "
2,"Hey, this game is great! Nice graphics, great sound, good puzzles, etc. The only thing that I did not like that much was, that you sometimes have to move through up to 3 screens without any contents. Well, there are nice graphics but nothing that would do anything. They don't even contain red herrings : But this game was still lot's of fun!"
1,"This a Casper the Friendly Ghost short from my childhood, and I re-watch it on YouTube (Thank GOD! for You Tube); after that I love this short, and it is one of my favorite Casper shorts.  I love how the short starts off spooky with Frank Gallop's haunting narration; until we get to see Casper sitting by his tombstone in the cemetery, reading. While every ghost rose from the graves to ""boo"" people, Casper decides to leave in search for a friend. But in trying to make a friend, anyone who sees Casper runs away. Poor Casper sat on a log and weep; until a little fox cub comes up an nuzzles him. Casper and the little fox quickly bond and he quickly names the cub Ferdie and considers him to be his very best friend.   Casper and Ferdie's relationship is put in tremendous jeopardy however when Casper is not keeping a close eye on Ferdie while they are playing a game of Hide and Seek. While Ferdie is hiding a hunter and two of his hunting dogs come and try to kill little Ferdie and Ferdie is running as fast as possible until he is out of breath and starts panting. While the hunter is firing gunshots towards Ferdie Casper notices they are trying to kill him and flies in the hunter's direction and pleads that the hunter leaves Ferdie alone. And the hunter and dogs are terrified of Casper. Casper yells to Ferdie that the hunter and the dogs are gone and that everything is fine. But Casper sees Ferdie's body is not moving and asks if he is OK. When Casper sees Ferdie has died he starts mourning in pain because he lost ""the only friend he ever had in his whole life."" Casper returns back to the cemetery where he has buried Ferdie and has made a gravestone for him next to Casper's gravestone. Casper continues mourning in pain until he sees that Ferdie has resurrected as a ghost himself. Ferdie starts licking Casper on his cheek. Casper screams for joy because he has been reunited with Ferdie.  Overall, it is a really good short; though surprisingly disturbing, showing death in a family-oriented cartoon."
2,"""If you like this title, we also recommend...  Boa vs. Python (2004) (TV).""   There's really not much more to say other than that, but I'll try: Imagine being strapped to a chair while every stupid person who has ever irritated you, wasted your time, or otherwise caused you grief pokes you repeatedly in the face with a rolled-up copy of the National Enquirer while explaining the plot of Jason and the Argonauts to you using no words that contain more than two syllables. That's how much fun you will probably have watching this movie. Cue next anonymous hyperbolic scathing."
1,"Eglimata (= Crimes) is a story about little crimes everyday people commit that in a crazy scenario could lead to the absolute disaster.One of the smartest Greek series ever!Actors like Ketty Konstadinou and Maria Kavogianni showed a whole new dimension of themselves and talent and gave us moments of incredible 'guilty' laughing.Every viewer seemed to recognise the bad side of their self in one of the characters or at least a side of their self they wish they had. Actors of every age that played bigger and smaller parts gained an equally big space in Greek audience's heart.My personal favourites (apart the first two i mentioned)are Vassilis Haralambopoulos, Athinodoros Prousalis and Stavros Nikolaidis but so many amazing actors passed by some episodes from time to time. Whoever around the world understands Greek should find a way to watch this series,even though it's been more than 5 years that it was on TV.In Greece they keep repeating the series (ANT1) in every chance there is like summertime or early afternoon zones.We'll never forget Eglimata or any of the casting crew!"
1,"I found Grey Garden's to be a gripping film, an amazingly intimate  look at too eccentrics who basically have the right idea: forget  society and live in a delapidated house with no heating and a huge  brood of cats and raccoons, persuing their own interests rather  mundainly, all the while chattering at the camera.  Big Edie and Little Edie are the two crazies that the Mazles Bros.  have chosen to document. They seem like characters out of a  Fellini film, only stranger, if that makes any sense. Old Edie is  almost fully bedridden, a pile of papers, clothes and dirty dishes  growing around her. Little Edie is even more interesting. She  prances around the house, always wearing a baboushka-like  headdress around her head, completely covering her hair. We  never see her hair throughout the film, nor do we ever get a hint  that she still has much. At age fifty eight, though, she is still  beautiful and full of life.  In Grey Gardens, we get the sense that both of these women's  lives have become much less than what they once were. Little  Edie is probably the sadder of the two. While her mother, in her  earlier years, got married, made a family, lived luxuriously and  even made some recordings (the scene where, at 77, she sings  along with a recording of ""Tea for Two"" she made decades ago is  one of the films best scenes), Edie left her promicing career as a  model to take care of her ailing mother. At 58, she still longed to  find her prince charming. If anything Little Edie is still a little girl,  full of dreams of glamour and fame, and of domestic and romantic  bliss, that have yet to be fulfilled.  Highlights of the film include the opening moments, where Little  Edie explains her outfit to the camera, the ""tea for two"" sequence,  the birthday party, the climactic argument, the grocery deliver  scene, and the scene in the attic. The whole thing is incredibly  candid and unpretencious. And it's made all the more remarcable  since it's all real.  I suggest seeing Grey Gardens back-to-back with the Kenneth  Anger short Puce Moment. The Criterion DVD is $35.00, but it's  worth every penny."
2,"Well, this movie may not be just another piece of crap like most of this type are, but I do not see any point to praise about it either. Same old premise -- destructed wasteland, no sign of sane life, deadly cyborgs reigning, some unlucky human beings... it works on a very cheap & boring formula. It reminds me of Van Damme's Cyborg, but somehow I feel this one better. Just because it has a better story. But please do not expect a breathtaking, mind dazzling sci-fi plot. I was just comparing.  The leadman, Joe Lara, is lucky that he turned out to be a cyborg in the end. Otherwise he himself should question his acting capability. Nicole Hansen added some human touch in this robot-robot game. At least she is the only human among the lead cast. And I'm still in dark why the director chose an old-man figure as the killing cyborg. 3/10."
0,"Yes, it can be done. John De Bello and Costa Dillon cleaned out the garbage of their minds and come up with the worst comedic, horror , Sc-Fi musical. If there is any acting, it is terrible or way over the top. Special effects; take your pick...very low budget or kindergarten. Every cheap cliché thought of is used. No doubt a fun movie to watch. Worth a cold six-pack or two. Point the finger at radiation if you need an excuse. Mutant tomatoes grow to almost the size of a tow truck and begin attacking mankind. San Diego is a good place as any to start. Scientists and an absent minded military must find the way to stop this red rolling menace. This cult favorite features: David Miller, Eric Christmas, Al Sklar, Tom Coleman, Sharon Taylor and John Qualls."
1,"If you're one of those who recognise with pleasure such arcane titles as 'Book of the Dead', 'Book of Eibon' or 'Necronomicon', then you should feel right at home with Malefique, a film which also features an occult tome, one with the power to change the destinies of all involved. Discovered by four French prisoners sharing a cell, the fearsome object has been placed in the wall there by Danvers, a serial killer incarcerated back in the 1920s; a man obsessed with rejuvenation and the black arts before he abruptly vanished. Finders of the book are Carrère (Gérald Laroche) a company embezzler shopped by his wife, Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) who aspires to be a woman but at the same time body-builds to execute an escape plan, the halfwit Pâquerette (Dimitri Rataud) who once ate his baby sister, and the 'librarian' Marcus (Clovis Cornillac), supposedly driven mad by reading, who murdered his wife. Reminding the viewer of Meat Loaf's equally bizarre, bosomy male in Fight Club (1999), Lassalle begins as the dominant member of the quartet, one who is especially protective of the infantile Pâquerette. With the coming of the book however, and the overarching need to decipher its dangerous contents, Marcus assumes greater and greater significance. At first assured of an early bail, meanwhile Carrère takes little more than academic interest in events. Suddenly he too needs an urgent escape option and, as the prisoners experiment, Danvers' book starts to reveal some of its terrifying powers...  Staged for the most part within a prison cell, and between four or five characters, Malefique has a claustrophobic air entirely suited to its subject matter (as well as the limited budget of the filmmakers). Only at the start and then at the conclusion do we get to leave the confines of the cell, a necessary opening out which only serves to emphasise the doomed, closed-in nature of proceedings elsewhere. More than anything, this is a film about being trapped, either as a victim of your criminal past or of occult events now unfolding. ""I'm going to escape,"" says Carrère at the start of the film, wishing more than anything to be able to rejoin his wife and son. Whether or not he does it will be at a terrible price, and the great irony of the film is that the ultimate form of an 'escape' may not be one a man might imagine.  With all its budget limitations it is greatly to the first-time feature director Eric Vallette's credit that his film succeeds as well as it does. As critics have noticed, it is a film with strong Freudian overtones - Lassalle's distinctive mammaries and adult breast feeding for instance; the picture of a vagina which comes to life and develops an eye; the grown man who dissolves back into a foetus; Danvers' original placenta fetish; the dark cell as a primitive womb from which 'delivery' is awaited, etc. With so many interesting aspects to the script Vallette hardly puts a foot wrong, and he succeeds in creating a genuinely unsettling atmosphere out of what, when one comes down to it, is just a matter of four guys, four bunks, one folding table and a book. There's a genuine, growing, Lovecraftian frisson as the men summon up the unnameable darkness from within its pages, while one or two moments - the aforementioned blinking vagina, or what ultimately happens to Pâquerette - are unsettlingly memorable. The pacing of many of the dark events in Malefique is deliberate, rejecting the rapid cutting of many Hollywood productions: a video culture approach that often subverts the horrified gaze in favour of quick-fix action and gore. Perhaps this is a particularly European manner, as one recalls a similar, measured approach to shocking hallucination taken in such films as Verhoeven's The Fourth Man (1983) - a film that incidentally also shares a particularly nasty image based around a prolapsed eye.  Lensed well in 1.85:1, Malefique benefits from excellent performances and, if for this viewer at least, the conclusion was not as explainable as it might have been, the journey to the final shot was worth taking. Coming so soon after the release of the similarly well-received Haute Tension (aka: Switchblade Romance, 2003), this is another reason to be grateful that good horror films are once again emerging from the French industry, this after a time when it seemed the only worthwhile product came from Asia"
2,"It's hard to believe that this year marks the 30th anniversary of ""American Graffiti"".  Other reviewers have already made mention of the fact that the outstanding success of this landmark film was almost single handedly responsible for igniting the ""retro"" craze that quickly grew into a major international subculture and is still going strong today. Although, back in the '70s we used the word ""nostalgia"".   The movie's soundtrack album, which was nothing more than a compilation of 1950s and early 60s Top 40 hits, generated massive sales figures across the globe and immediately triggered a flood of similar vinyl offerings from other record companies.   I turned 13 in 1973 and, like so many teenagers of the time, I totally lost interest in the music of the day and started to collect many of the aforementioned compilation albums.  Again, as others have correctly pointed out, the initial retro scene was mainly confined to the musical side of things which included the establishment of ""Oldies"" radio stations. It wasn't long, however, before the general mood of nostalgia became more widespread with an increasing number of people becoming interested in other pop culture commodities of the era such as movies,TV shows, cars and clothes.  Pretty soon the whole thing exploded and the ""Good Old Days"" suddenly became big business. And why not? There's some fabulous entertainment to be found in the archives for those who care to look.  Give me 'dem ole' time movies any day of the week! In fact, when you look back, I think we owe a debt of gratitude to George Lucas and the gang for giving us ""American Graffiti"". It started a positive and enjoyable marketing trend which has brought a great deal of pleasure to millions over the years. And that's a pretty nice legacy for any movie to leave behind."
2,"A down-trodden girl, a mutt dog, and a criminal fugitive on the run. Sounds a lot like 1941's High Sierra, even down to lead actress Ida Lupino. But it doesn't matter that these elements got recycled, because Deep Valley is a really watchable 90 minutes of Hollywood melodrama. Sure, it's hokey at times, especially the weepy ending that's squeezed for all its worth. But the movie is also a testimonial to the demandingly high standards of Hollywood studio production-- scope out the great farm house that almost looks like Katrina hit it, and the road project that looks so real, I expect it was. There's also the exquisite b&w photography from cameraman Ted Mc Cord, along with expert direction from studio ace Jean Negulesco. But most of all, it's the absolutely luminous performance from Lupino in the central role. Was there anyone ever better at playing soulful parts. Here, her stuttering, long-suffering farm girl whose only joy is her dog and the great outdoors, is enough to move the Rock of Gibraltar, and is surely Oscar-worthy. Speaking of the outdoors, it's also a measure of the film's underlying romanticism that the lovers seek refuge in the liberating openness of nature, and away from the blessings of civilization. For each has been brutalized by societal forces larger than themselves. Dane Clark is very good too, even if he never got past second fiddle to John Garfield-- then too, his strictly blue-collar personality was a poor fit for the upwardly mobile 1950's, and by that white-collar decade, he was gone. Anyhow, this super-slick film again demonstrates how wonderfully vital B-pictures of the studio era could be, and is well worth a look see."
2,"A very strange movie indeed. The opening sequence of LeBlanc's escape from the Germans with a complete Enigma machine only to have it destroyed by a numb skulled, British officer is played very much for laughs. Even later, as the ""Team"" is assembled it is played very lightly, a lot of gags based on the wartime London Gay scene. Eddie Izzard shines here, his genuine warmth and good humour fill the screen.  Once dropped behind enemy lines the whole thing changes direction, one undercover Englishamn takes a beating before LeBlanc rescues him and beats the German to a pulp. Later the same Brit is about to be captured when LeBlanc knifes the German - pretty tough stuff for a comedy!  Good points: The running gag of the hapless Brit constantly wanting to use the toilet (and forgetting his drag and using the gents!) The production design for the Enigma assembly factory, very convincing, with long rows of workbenches with machines in various states of preparation.  Bad points: The strange uniforms that some of the Germans wear, look like Carnival Nazis! and the love interest frankly doesn't work."
2,"Mix together Rushmore, Thumbsucker, and Ferris Bueller's Day Off, sprinkle in some odd classics but go real light on creativity and originality, and you got Charlie Bartlett. The movie is a mess. Lots of moments stolen from other ""High School movies"" but no clarity and the movie is completely ridiculous and unrealistic; moments like Charlie (and shortly after the whole school) going completely ape on what was supposedly a LOW dosage of ritalin were very frustrating. But most importantly, it is completely uninspired and surprisingly boring. You know there's something wrong when even Robert Downey Jr. is uninteresting in a character that made me wonder why he chose to do the movie in the first place. Moments like the musical tribute to Harold and Maude (""If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out"")just made me think: ""Why am I watching this movie; I should be watching that one"" which made it very hard to appreciate the few moments that were good."
1,Omar Epps is an outstanding actor. I really think he gets into his character alot. When deja gets shot he shows true emotion. He also shows true emotion when remmi puts the gun to him in the room. Omar is a very talented actor!!
2,"Sometimes you discover that a movie is not that good but better than you expected, sometimes you go to the movies expecting an unforgettable time and leave the theater with a ""it-was-very-good-but-could-be-better"" feeling. Prince of Egypt fits the last case.  It's all there: the visual impact, the fantastic scenes (the one in the Red Sea is no less than wonderful), the emotions attached to a very known story, etc. But this could be the best of all the movies in animation history and it isn't.  First of all, this Moses is like a shadow, he should be the soul of the story but feels like he's just passing through it; even his sister Mirian is more expressive than him. The personality of someone who has been chosen by God to free His people and, for that very reason, must throw his past away, could be much better explored.  There are too musical scenes too. I know they're different from another scores, as long as they're sometimes close to an opera act, but this shouldn't be an excuse to fill almost the entire plot with them. The one in the very beginning and the last, with the made-to-be hit ""when you believe"", are very fine; but the one with the priests is completely strange to the movie's mood. And, worse, the part that shows the plagues is a waste of good cinematography possibilities: it's all filled with songs and music. It seems like they didn't know how to do the scene and then decided to make a musical out of it. I really don't understand why animated stories must always be entwined with that horrible Broadway style.  But don't misunderstand me, you should watch this movie, and in the big screen. Although the plot is filmed mostly with a visual point of view, there are memorable scenes that can make you feel fully delighted and they're worth the price of the ticket. Otherwise, if you wait for the video, you might think this is just another one."
2,"I wasn't too sure when I picked up this movie. The first few minutes were actually kinda nauseating the way the picture shot. But after used to it, I found it to be more real. The story doesn't flow like normal, rather it drips on you like leaking faucet. Telling you bits of the character as it goes. The acting of the main actor Rodolphe Marconi is very promising. His eyes tells a lot more than anything else. Somehow I keep comparing him to Jake Gylenhaal, maybe just the look. Overall great effort from an all rounder producer/actor/writer. I highly recommend this study of human's emotion. When feelings are too strong to be contained. Like the character said ""have you ever been lost, and you are aware that you are lost, but you can not do anything about it?"""
2,"A crooked doctor. A bootlegger hero. A heroine who socks people.  Child abuse! Drunkenness! Gun-pointing!  You can really tell this one is pre-Production Code.  (The shady physician's pronounced facial tic will remind many Canadians immediately of a certain discredited Olympic sports doctor.)  Barbara Stanwyck is good in an early role, and Joan Blondell, well, what a shameless scene-stealer.  Then there's those subjective camera shots from inside the careering ambulance! Whoa! It's just like ""Cinerama""! Grab onto something quick"
2,"Well, I went in to this film knowing full well it was no ""Star wars"" but this was extra cheesy. I love sci-fi movies and hoped this would at lest entertain me for a while. I was wrong. As for the sci-fi part, it was missing. First of all there was no time travail, time warping...nothing to do with time but wasting it. This was not even a B-movie. Saddly, the acting and FX were not so great ether. They stunk. It looks like they filmed it in an old wear house. I don't even remember if I made it to the end of this bomb. This had o be a tax right-off for someone. If you like bombs, or hate your self, then this for you, if not stay away...far away. Run if you have to."
2,"How many movies are made that involve police corruption, where the corruption always runs higher than expected? How many crime rings run by corrupt police officers have been thwarted by civilians (in the movies of course)? Todo el Poder has your typical corrupt cop scenario, and plays out as expected. I have seen this movie around a dozen times, all under different titles, and wasn't very impressed by this one.  The plot is the problem: there are no unexpected turns or developments. Even though the film looks decent enough, and the acting is fair, the plot isn't intriguing enough to make you want to continue watching it.  I'm not sure if it was funny, either. I realized there were humorous parts, but I didn't laugh. This, most likely, can be blamed on the fact that I had to read subtitles.  Overall, if you are not tired of the old scenario, and don't mind reading subtitles, you may find this one enjoyable."
2,"The story has been remade so many times very few people know of the original, and the best, in fact I had not even heard of it until I found a copy in my dads huge collection of old video tapes, and I decided I might as well watch it, what else to do, in the end it ended up being one of the best films I had everseen. Filled with amazing power, and the best visual effects that I have seen in any film from the thirties, much less the twenties. It also has some wonderful performances by its hole cast, and is expertly directed, in almost a Spielberg way, with the talent of Alfred Hitchcock. No matter how against watching old movies you are, you should watch this masterpiece, I have watched it over and over again, it never gets old.  If you enjoyed The Lost World, you might also like, On the Waterfront, Its a Wonderful Life, and Jurasic Park."
2,"This is simply a masterpiece. There is a fantastic story line, there is just enough of the whole one dimensional character aspect to so many of the baddies here, but wonderful explorations of De Niro's and Grodin's characters. Truly, the film explores right and wrong and comes up on the side of the Angels. Angels with dirty faces maybe, but Angels nonetheless. No commentary on this film could be complete without remarking upon De Niro's incredible comic role. I haven't been moved by any of his comic turns since... indeed upon reflection, could it not be suggested that Raging Bull was in essence, high class comedy? Never mind... a piece of magic."
2,"This is one of the best Swedish Movies i ever seen. If you like Vikings/crossbows and swords see it! Denmark attacks scone, no mans land. Sweden defends their self and attacks the Danish troops, they doesn't want Denmark in scone. They might want more land then that. Swedish troops from middle of Sweden, Stockholm does not like people living in scone (skåningar) and they burn and kill those who refuse to fight against Denmark.  Rebel groups called ""Snapphanar"" is growing up to take the fight against the Swedish troops that is burning their villages and killing their wife's and children.  I live in Sweden, and i love Sweden. I have never liked Skane, but Swedes was pigs in this movie and i my hate against them growth stronger and stronger during the film. Go Snapphanar, go go go!"

1,"My personal favorite horror film. From the lengthy first tracking shot to the final story twist, this is Carpenter's masterpiece.  Halloween night 1963, little Michael Meyers murders his older sister. All-hallows-eve 1978, Michael escapes from Smith's Grove sanitarium. Halloween night, Michael has come home to murder again.  The story is perfectly simple, Michael stalks and kills babysitters. No bells or whistles, just the basics. It's Carpenter's almost over-powering atmosphere of dread that generates the tension. Like any great horror film, events are telegraphed long in advance, yet they still seem to occur at random, never allowing the audience to the chance to second guess the film.  The dark lighting, the long steady-cam shots, and (most importantly) that damn eerie music create the most claustrophobic and uncomfortable scenes I have yet to see in film. There is a body count, but compared to the slew of slashers after this it's fairly small. That and most of the murders are nearly bloodless. The fear is not in death, but in not knowing.  The acting is roundelay good. PJ Soles provides much of the films limited humor (and one of the best deaths), Nancy Loomis turns in a decent performance and then there is the young (at the time) Jamie Leigh-Curtis. Her performance at first seems shy and un-assured, yet you quickly realize that it is perfect for the character, who is herself shy and un-assured and not at all prepared for what she is to face. And of course there is the perfectly cast Donald Pleasence as the determined (perhaps a little unstable) Dr. Sam Loomis. Rest in peace Mr. Pleasence.  If the film has a detrimental flaw, it would be the passage of time. Since the release of this film so many years ago nearly countless clones, copies, rip-offs, and imitators have come along and stolen (usually badly) the films best bits until nearly everything about it has become familiar. Combined with the changes for audience expectations and appetites, one finds much of the films raw power diluted. To truly appreciate it in this day and age, it must be viewed as it once was, as something unique.  Never the less, I have no reservation with highly recommending this film to anyone looking for a good, scary time. Highest Reguards.  10/10"
2,"The Petrified Forest - what that title means, aside from its actual geographic location, I'm not sure. It's about a little bar on the outskirts of civilization (Arizona or New Mexico) where its run by an old man and his daughter or granddaughter (Bette Davis) who keeps getting courted by a football veteran. Enter Alan Squier (Leslie Howard) who has those ""book-smarts"" and has been around to places like Paris and wrote a book but is now at a crossroads in his life - just the moment to meet a very curious-minded girl like Gabrielle, who, as happens in movies of the period, gets smitten with the guy immediately. But there's a snag when a notorious gangster, Duke Mantee (Bogart), has to hold up at the bar with his fellow gangsters and holds everybody hostage while they wait. This doesn't stop the drama from unfolding, however, nor the talk about wealth and power, first with old man at the bar and then when an upper-class couple who got stranded in a sandstorm come in and also get in on the conversation.  This is one of those ""talky"" movies- meaning very little in the way of action or for ways of Archie Mayo, the director, to try his hand at any special maneuvers with the lens- but it's a good one, and has some challenging little bits from the period. It turns into one of those interesting microcosms that we see sometimes in stage plays or in movies, where a group of people who usually would just say hello/goodbye and be on their way (if that) are thrown together: a smart guy like Alan who becomes heroic after imbibing a few dozen shots; a gruff gangster like Mantee who talks in a way (and by Bogart's performance) where you're not sure what's sarcastic or real; Gabrielle as the girl who two guys are pining for and is not sure what she'll do. Then there's the arrogant jock who ends up getting shot, and the rich couple who have their own sort of long-time-married camaraderie that's mildly amusing. There's even a moment I wasn't expecting where the black gangster in Mantee's group gives some lip to the rich couple's chauffeur for being so ""yes, ma'am"" and not standing up for himself. Black power in 1936, who knew?!   This is not a great movie really by any stretch, and despite a strong climax it ends up getting deflated somewhat from a last-minute obvious note on the getaway of the gangsters that seems very Hayes-code inspired (ambiguity would've benefited, frankly). But the performances make it something of a must-see, with the three leads of Howard and Davis and especially Bogart a great trio to bounce off of one another. While it was another payday for Howard and Davis, both very charming here, this was Bogart's big break (albeit it would be a while before he could shake his bad-guy act in his roles) and he takes it on for all its worth. Just watch him in that scene where he finds out his other gangster pals and his girl have been arrested and his girl may have squealed and he's ""gotta think."" It's priceless. 8.5/10"
1,"RKO studios decided to borrow both William Powell from MGM and Jean Arthur from Columbia, for one of their more big budget efforts to cash in on the popularity of The Thin Man. They succeeded to some degree.  A lot of folks forget that in addition to and earlier than Nick Charles, Bill Powell also played in a few Philo Vance films in the title role. So by this time he was pretty well set in the role. Doctor Bradford is not doing as many liquid lunches as Nick Charles, but the basic blasé Nick is still there. One difference is that while Nick Charles married an heiress, Doctor Bradford works for a living as a physician. That helps in his avocation of detective and in fact it does in this film.  He's got two murders to solve. A jockey falls off a horse coming into the homestretch of a big race and dies for no apparent reason. The trainer suspects something afoot, but he's bumped off by the more conventional method of a bullet. This is after he comes to Bill Powell for help.  Myrna Loy was a more steadying influence on Bill Powell than Jean Arthur was. Arthur plays it as more of a dizzy dame than Loy did. But it works here and she and Powell have good chemistry.  The ever dependable James Gleason is the police inspector in the Sam Levene/Nat Pendleton role. All they needed here was Asta and possibly Eric Blore as Powell's butler was essaying that part.  If Powell and Arthur were signed at this studio we might have seen a whole slew of Bradford films."
1,"I've seen this movie, when I was traveling in Brazil. I found it difficult to really understand Brazilian culture and society, because it has so many regional and class differences. To see this movie in Sao Paulo itself was a revelation. It shows something of the everyday life of many Brazilians. On the other side, it is sometimes a little bit over-dramatized. And that's the only negative comment I have on this film. It's sometimes too much, too much sex, too many murders and too much cynicism for one film. The director could film some things a bit more subtle, it would make the film more effective.  Despite this I liked the movie and the way the story unravels itself. The characters are complex, and very much like real-life people. Not pretty American actors and actresses with a lot of cosmetics, but people who could be ugly and beautiful at the same time. That makes the film realistic, even when the story is not that convincing."
0,"A story of amazing disinterest kills ""The Psychic"" over and over again. The characters and plot are completely uninteresting (as is Fulci's mad camera work, which is usually a redeeming factor in his films), and any grasp of suspense is nowhere to be found. It's padded out to an insufferable degree--by the end, you won't be clamoring with excitement but stricken with boredom (and, like me, maybe an uncontrollable urge to fall asleep). Jennifer O'Neill's performance deserves occupancy in a better movie. Fulci gorehounds beware--there's just not much going on in ""The Psychic.""  3/10"
2,"Sean Abley's film ""Socket"" fails in every respect; the story is flat, pointless, and uninteresting, the acting is remarkably unprofessional, the cinematography reflects a frightening absence of creativity (or even competence), and the director reveals that he has no eye for screen presentation. One wonders how it's possible to expend the time, money, and effort required to create a film, and to then turn an apparently blind eye to the final product. The movie is presented as a gay horror film, so we're treated to pointless sex-oriented nudity, which delivers no heat whatsoever. Indeed, one wonders whether director Abley was more concerned about the film's gay/nudity aspect than its horror aspect. Either way, none of it delivers. These characters give gay people a bad name: boring. The DVD offers a ""special feature"" section wherein the cast and crew discuss the making of the film. It is pathetic to listen to these people discuss their effort as though they had created something worthwhile. Sorry, this film is terrible."
2,"This review applies to big brother in general as well. For the 9th season, the tasks for the shopping budget have improved and seem less shoddy the in previous series. The cast was predictable, with the notable recurring characters including the camp homosexual, the token minority, middle-aged woman acting like a 3 year old, prick teaser, arrogant pretty boy, insecure pretty boy, the mother/cleaner, etc. This year the dull, boring and fake person who played dumb won the show for at a least a third consecutive time. I don't need to watch it next year because I know who's going to win. 95% contestants are acting up to the cameras making the show entirely superficial whether it be to win or to be noticed. Another thing is that the type off people who end up on big brother are shallow or lack character depth. The show uses political correctness to it's advantages jumping on any opportunity out of anything that displeases the average left wing extremist to make headlines and increase ratings. That alone defeats the purpose of the experiment due to too much influence from the outside world. I rate this season 3 out of 10, this program is ready for the scrap heap."
2,"This movie can absolutely cause a depression for the rest of your weekend. It is the absolute hardcore movie of the inhumanity at Auswitch Birkenau. It shows a group of Hungarian Jews how are forced into working the gas chambers and crematoria the so called 'sonder commandos'. The scale of the mass murder has never been shown so graphically , and I have seen quiet a lot of WOII movies. Forced participation in the mass murder and the inhumanely dally routine this creates is the central theme of this movie. Through out the movie the mass of people being murdered and the 'alien' situation this creates makes it difficult to identify whit any of the victims or other characters in the movie. This remains until the 3 minutes before the end of the movie. After the rebellion of the sonder commandos is smashed by the SS, a trilling poem by a murdered gill sums up the final end of the sonder commandos. The poem and imagery shoots through the hart."
2,"I'd never heard of this film before TCM started screening it as a late night filler - and initially woke up in the middle of it when Holloway and co were singing the poignant and totally unexpected The World is for the Young. I actually couldn't get the song out of my head for several days.   After that I kept stumbling across bits of it on different screenings and each time I said to my wife ""I kinda like this movie"" Tonight I finally managed to watch it from the start and although as a film it doesn't really amount to much it's such a good natured, sweet and enjoyably off kilter movie that it just makes me feel good to see it.   I wanted to see what other people thought and it seems a few reviewers do get it - whereas some others seem to get strangely vindictive and offended.  Yes it's completely out of jaunt with it's year and the Hermits were anachronisms by 1968 but Peter No one (I tried to make his surname come out correct) is perfectly fine in the lead, the supporting cast is great, the brightly coloured widescreen is a pleasure to the eyes.   Guilty pleasure or not I've really warmed to this."
1,"I went to see Ashura as 2005 Fantasia Festival Kickoff. Man, that was one cool kick off. The director was supposed to be in Montreal for the Canadian premiere, but due to health reasons, he's still in Japan...oh lord I hope he gets better and makes plenty of other movies.  The plot is pretty simple, but somewhat original...the demons are roaming in Edo in Japan and Swordsmans called ""Demon Wardens"" are slaying them and fearing the rebirth of Ashura, the demon goddess who's sleeping and supposedly is very kick-ass.  It brings us to Izumo...some kind of elite swordsman called ""Demon Slayer"" and his buddy Jaku who's the typical violent jealous asshole...  Seems boring? Well now it thickens....  Izumo took his retirement from killing demons since he slayed a young kid on the ""impression"" that he was the demon, he never knew, but he did killed her. So Izumo went on with his life and recycled himself in Kabuki theater. In a boat joyride on a nice night, Izumo spots a girl hiding on a bridge and it changes his life and restart to slay demons...for the good cause, the cause of love...and damn...the guy knows how to handle a sword and to pull an entertaining massacre.  Izumo carries the movie as far as playing goes...he is the total package...he knows how to fight(hell yeah he knows), he's witty, he's intelligent and he has that grit. You never have to yell :""NO IZUMO, IT'S A TRAP"" The guy already knows it he has that common sense. He's really the perfect hero.  As far as cinematography goes, the esthetics are pretty interesting. It's by far, the movie that looks the most like a manga. It's creamed full of special effects and nothing, at all cost will prevent this movie to look realistic...it's pretty amazing. Lots of colours an ""unreal"" photography, other than that...it's pretty straightforward...but like I said, the main character is carrying the movie A must see, a tale lead by masterful hands"
2,"Though undeniably enjoyable, the popular poliziottesco subgenre - which proliferated in Italy throughout the 1970s - is also frustrating because one can never tell the quality of a specific title until one has watched it himself (this is mainly due to the fact that this type of film has been largely dismissed by the critics, while at the same time turned into a cult by fans): the thing is that a handful of titles definitely merit a critical re-appraisal, while many others are overrated by the aficionados. Personally, during the last few years, I've sampled films which fall in both these categories - but, thankfully, EMERGENCY SQUAD turned out to be one of the best poliziotteschi out there.  Having just watched ROME ARMED TO THE TEETH (1976), whose narrative was all over the place, it's easy to see how EMERGENCY SQUAD benefits from having a tight, compelling plot line. Besides, I tend to find star Tomas Milian more interesting when playing an anti-hero (as here or in his better Spaghetti Westerns) than an out-and-out villain. The film is clearly inspired by both DIRTY HARRY (1971) - the taciturn, iconoclastic cop hero with a dead spouse - and THE FRENCH CONNECTION (1971) - the desire for revenge has turned Milian's pursuit of gang boss Gastone Moschin (who, like Fernando Rey in that movie, also hails from Marseilles) into an obsession; curiously enough, the dock finale of this film anticipates the one in FRENCH CONNECTION II [1975]! Moschin (terrific as the anti-hero hood in MILANO CALIBRO 9 [1972]) is a credible villain here, also because the script has atypically made him a victim of tuberculosis.  The supporting cast is led by Stefania Casini, who has fun with her role as a ditzy gangster's moll but isn't really given a lot to do: the actress' above-the-title billing certainly suggests that her character will be more central to the main plot and that, perhaps, she'll become involved with Milian at some point - but they only get to share one scene at the very end! Also featured, among others, are Mario Carotenuto (as Milian's elderly sidekick and conscience) and Ray Lovelock (as one of Moschin's lackeys, though he exits the proceedings rather quickly in one of the film's best scenes).  Director/co-writer Massi's background as a cinematographer is evident in the film's stylish look (even if there's an over-abundance of zoom shots), and equally notable is the inventive editing technique adopted throughout (which shows a definite influence from modern American films - the overlapping of shots from successive scenes before a full transition being borrowed from EASY RIDER [1969], the juxtaposition in slo-mo of Moschin's death with that of Milian's wife at the climax from the work of Sam Peckinpah). Regular genre composer Stelvio Cipriani contributes an excellent and eclectic score, providing several variations on the catchy main theme throughout.  The plot, meanwhile, shows the gang cleverly take up various disguises to accomplish their criminal schemes (dressing up as undertakers, members of a film crew and priests during the course of the film); interestingly, the scene in which they hold a family hostage will be reprised in Milian's subsequent and better-known effort in the genre, ALMOST HUMAN (1974) - where he actually plays the psychotic leader of a gang of crooks. Also, the vulgar humor associated with the genre only makes itself felt in the scenes taking place on the set of an erotic movie and, later, in a hippie commune; in fact, the film's tone is generally quite serious - but this doesn't mean that the hard-boiled dialogue, which so characterizes the poliziotteschi, has been downplayed (thus raising the occasional chuckle, especially among those fluent in Italian).  I watched this via a recording off Italian TV but as the reception wasn't perfect - not to mention the fact that I was surprisingly impressed by the film - I'll have to pick up No Shame's reportedly solid R1 DVD release somewhere down the line..."
2,"When one thinks of the cowboy Western names like John Ford, Sam Peckinpah, Howard Hawks and John Huston might come to mind but Japanese new wave and cult director Miike Takashi would probably be the last person you would think of being on that list, that is until now. With his recent ""Sukiyaki Western Django"" Miike pays loving tribute to the western genre and infuses it with his own unique spin and a decidedly Japanese flair.  Set in what appears to be a dusty post-apocalyptic wasteland, the story deals with a bitter rivalry between two vicious clans - the brutal Heike (whose color emblem is a bloody scarlet red) and the flashy Genji (whose banners are a snow colored white). They have taken over a remote mountain village in a region oddly called ""Nevada"" (using Japanese Kanji equivalents).   Both factions have learned of a mythic gold depository in the surrounding area and have torn the village apart to find it but to no avail. The local inhabitants have long since fled and those that have stayed behind have been living in terror ever since.   A mysterious gun fighter with no name (Ito Hideaki) rides into town and offers his services to the clan who offers to pay him the most. While both clans make tempting bids, the gun fighter rejects both offers and is instead swayed to hold off joining either faction by the town's salon madam, Ruriko (Momoi Kaori).  Ruriko tells the stranger of how the town was taken over by the clans and how her son, Akira was killed by them. Akira was a former Heike clan member who had fallen in love with the beautiful Shizuka (Yoshino Kimura), a member of the rival clan. They had hoped that their union would help encourage peace between the two clans but instead Akira is murdered by the Heike's ruthless leader Kiyomori (Sato Koichi).   Devasted she returns to her clan with her young child Heihachi, where she is forced to become a harlot to the clan's charismatic and mercurial leader Yoshitsune.  As the conflict comes to an impasse both sides scheme at how to gain the upper-hand. Kiyomori tells his clansmen that it is divine destiny that they will win the conflict and sites Shakespeare's ""Henry VI"" and the English conflict of the ""War of the Roses"" (where the red side wins) as his bible. He is so sure of this that he adopts the name ""Henry"".  On the Genji side, Yoshitsune has found the location of a hidden cache of weapons including a functioning Gatling gun which he hopes will give his clan the advantage. He sends his chief henchman, Benkei (Ishibashi Takaaki) to retrieve the weapon.  The gun fighter learns of this plan from Shizuka and relays the information to the Heike clan.  For her betrayal Shizuka is brutally murdered by the Genji clan and the gun fighter is severely injured. Nursed back to health the gun fighter teams up with Ruriko, who reveals herself to be the legendary gun fighter ""B.B."" who was a protégé of one of the first western gunmen in Japan, ""Bingo"" (cameo by Quentin Tarantino) to destroy the clans and bring peace to the town.   Miike and screenwriter NAKA(Masa)MURA borrow liberally from other westerns particularly the landmark ""Italiano-Westerns"" of Sergio Leone (Fist Full of Dollars, The Good, The Bad & The Ugly"") and Sergio Corbucci (Django) as well as the so-called ""Acid-Westerns"" of Alejandro Jodorowsky (El Topo) but adds in his own unique aspects and New Wave flourishes to create a Japanese version of the classic western albeit with a decidedly Japanese look and feel. The name is both a play on ""spaghetti"" (Italian) westerns and an anecdote where ""sukiyaki"" (Japanese nabemono or ""stew"") combines various elements in a pot.   Much has been said of Miike's decision to script the dialog entirely in English but I think the cast should be commended for actually pulling off what might have turned into a comical disaster. It also helped that Miike had the good fortune of hiring actors who have either lived or studied extensively abroad.  Ito Hideaki (Crossfire, Limit of Love-Umizaru) plays the titular Clint Eastwood role as the ""man with no name""/gun fighter. His performance is good but one note as he doesn't really have much range and his lines are minimal. Sato Koichi (Cheerful Gang Turns The Earth, Tennen Kokekko) is pure evil as ""Taira No Kiyomori"" who fancies himself after Shakespeare's ""Henry VI"". His performance brings to mind Mifune Toshiro's Kikuchiyo in ""Seven Samurai"" (manic, bestial, and cocksure of himself).   Fashion model turned actor Iseya Yusuke (Casshern, Memories of Matsuko) turns in another fantastic performance as the vicious yet wickedly handsome ""Minamoto No Yoshitsune"", a man who fancies himself as the embodiment of the Japanese ""Samurai spirit"". Iseya is quickly making a name for himself playing quirky roles and whose intensity and presence reminds me a lot of the late Heath Ledger.   London born Yoshino Kimura (Sakuran, The Backdancers) brings much passion, dignity and raw sexuality to her part as the tragic Shizuka. Momoi Kaori (Bounce No Ko Gal, Memoirs of a Geisha), who was also educated in London, is clearly at home with the English dialog and turns in a terrific performance as Ruriko.  Ishibashi Takaaki (one half of 80s comedy duo ""Tunnels"")steals the spotlight as Yoshitsune's sexually ambiguous henchman as does Kagawa Teruyuki (HERO, Tokyo.Sora) as the cowardly and opportunistic sheriff who seems almost possessed at times.  Following the heals of great modern western-themed movies and remakes of late like ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""3:10 To Yuma"", Miike's ""Sukiyaki Western Django"" is a fun and unique take on the western and as it's name suggests offers a clever take with a Japanese bent. Like trendy Asian ""fusion"" cuisine, ""Sukiyaki"" takes the best of both worlds and offers up something new yet oddly familiar. Bon appetite!"
0,"I can't believe that so much talent can be wasted in one movie! The Gingerbread Man starts of on the right foot, and manages to build up some great expectations for the ending. But at some point the movie turns into one of the worst stories I've ever wasted my time on. It's just so unbelievably how the bewitched Mallory Doss manages to pull Kenneth Branagh's character around by his nose. The movies climax is as uninteresting and flat as a beer, which has been left out in the sun too long. The Gingerbread Man is probably the worst Grisham-movie ever and this isn't changed by the fact that talented stars crowd the movie. Don't waste your time here!"
2,"This is probably the best treatment of Jane Eyre I've seen. A novel this rich does not adapt well to a two hour film, and this five hour production allows for a more than adequate treatment of the depth and scope of Bronte's work. The narration by Jane herself is a unique approach that I found very interesting and added to the depth of not only Jane herself but also to the other characters about whom she continually muses. Sorcha Cusack and Michael Jayston are excellently paired and are, in my opinion, the finest Jane and Rochester I've seen, both in terms of characterization and looks. Finally a Jane and Rochester who aren't too beautiful!"
2,"I think my fellow reviewers are overstating things a bit. Roma Violenta is by no means a bad movie, but it does nothing any number of poliziotteschi films can't do better and it doesn't impress with what it does either.  Maurizio Merli plays another inspector, this time Commisarrio Betti. There's a healthy number of car chases, fistfights, gundowns and just about anything you would expect from a film of this kind, but it's all done with such a workmanlike air from Marino Girolami (Castellari's father) that I couldn't help but glance at my watch every now and then. Girolami does Roma Violenta with the get-it-over-with attitude of a professional instead of the enthusiasm of a fan. Get in, take the master shot, take the close-ups, get it over with cos there's a paycheck in the end. No imagination whatsoever. I can imagine him on set crossing things off a list: ""Car chase? Check. Fistfight? Check"".  Polizioto fans that need their fix will be satisfied by Roma Violenta, but if you haven't seen true genre classics like The Cynic, The Rat and The Fist, Almost Human or La Mala Ordina, then Roma Violenta can wait."
2,"This movie had to be the single worst example of a manga/anime-to-movie transition to ever come into existence. NOTHING about this flaming pile of dung was good.  We had a hairy white guy with a Japanese name (who was SUPPOSEDLY the master of the Hokuto Shinken martial art) who could barely land a decent punch on his goofy and wholly ineffectual enemies, another hairy white guy (who was SUPPOSEDLY a master of the Nanto Koshuken form of the Nanto Seiken martial art) who, as was mentioned in a previous comment, fought like a common street thug and sported a hilariously stupid accent, a Japanese lady who couldn't speak a lick of English and had to read cue cards written in her native language to struggle through all of her scenes (all 0.015 of them), a total switch around of the Hokuto no Ken characters and canon, acting bad enough to strip the paint from a wall, the most mind-numbingly fake movie sets in the history of the universe, and a less-than-healthy dosage of regurgitated ""mystic oriental proverbs"" courtesy of Ryuken (which of course made absolutely NO sense whatsoever).  A complete and utter bastardization.  And even if I hadn't seen this lame-assed movie with the knowledge of its origin, I would've still given it a failing grade. The fight scenes were laughable, the plot razor thin (without the campy goodness from the anime and manga that made it fun), the actors wooden and unconvincing, and the enjoyment null and void.  There were no good points to this film. Absolutely none. It's a failure of the highest degree and its existence should be removed from all human memory."
2,"There are 5 stories that somehow connect but not really intertwine (this is the deceptive part), however, I liked all of them, the movie puts a especial emphasis in bizarreness, but it doesn't go too far.  Wife and Husband- This is in fact the fantastic part of the movie, the silentness of the wife is the main tool for getting you into that sweet vacillation of whether things are real or not, but there are lot more, as the costumes she wears every time (Which reminds me to a movie knows as ""héroe"" by this latitudes) and the phase-shifts. Here we also have the sweet dose of violence.  Killers - I got pretty surprised when I ran into ""Big Chris""! The contrast between Jones and the translator was way bizarre. There's not much going on here, since both of them are like a lone functional character.  Birdman- The ""strange"" vector of the film, yet the cutest, Keiichi's perspective keeps the frankness of children accurately. I LOVED the teacher scene.  Yoko the Creative- Oh god, Yoko's ideas for commercials are so unfunny they become funny, and Yoko is funny herself. Really laugh with the way she laughs and with the wild winking when she's having her ""afflati"". Here I may mark two characters I would had LOVED to see a little bit more of = The café girls. The accident girl was so funnily pathetic, and that were really strengthened by the uncaring friend. I wonder what would have happened to her if she'd got a third scene!!  The Housebreakers = And again we find a bizarre contrast, this time between the ""ugly"" and the ""sexy"" burglars. This story takes little of the film's length and it is also the most disconnected one, but adds a funky ""sexuality"" note.  And to finish, I liked the music."
2,"It's out on rent so, rent it.   Man, is really good. It deals with a few stories that are connected if you think about it, mainly by a building.   Love, lost, memories and discoveries are the main emotions that drive this movie. Again, another perfect film that's plot-less. This film even has an event, which has been done over and over in film but, just because you are not attached to a plot it seems like the most original event in the movie. Mothers, daughters, friends and fathers are all living their lives, like any of us, not noticing the small things in life. Our sense, specially sight and sound are over stimulated by this beautiful movie. The little simple things is what drives this movie and god that's filmmaking, that's art. Let me tell you how good it is, is so good, the movie was over and I stopped the DVD and started it again, I was it twice last night I think I'll see it tonight again.  "
1,"Twenty five years ago, I showed this film in some children's classes in Entomology and can still remember the excitement of the kids; they were spellbound! It is not just about the termites who have built and live in the ""Castles of Clay,"" but also about the other animals who use the mounds. There is a fantastic scene in which a cobra fights a monitor lizard while a colony of mongooses watch. It is a not only good for entomology classes, but also for teaching about ecology since there is so much about the interactions between the termites and other organisms and the whole ecology of all of the organisms that live in and around the mounds.   I wish it was available on DVD, so that I could watch it again and show others."
2,"It's just not funny.  Even viewed as a film of its time, it's still not very amusing. Neither of the two main characters has any charm or comic timing - the only mildly amusing character is Blakey the inspector. How this was ever a success is a mystery.  However, there is one amusing part: The theme tune. It has this wonderfully dated lyric:  ""It's such a gay life on the buses. Make sure you leave your bird at home."" That's a classic.  "
2,"this is an erotic but unpretentious x movie. exotic locations, great music, beautiful costumes and the debut of then 22 years old sylvia krystel pursuing sex joy before the dawn of aids fear. need to say more? a real classic that has stand the test of time. no wonder it has been shown in french cinema for 10 years and still shown in film festivals. it is also exported to 86 countries, sold more copies than ""titanic"". just watch and admire. they don't make such decent x movie anymore.  "
2,"The Title of this film is how one could describe the time that the cast and crew took out of their lives to make this stinker of a zombie flick. Dead Life barely looks like a movie. It looks like it was shot on Super 8 film and director William Victor Schotten apparently has no idea how or where to place the camera. His shots make Kevin Smith's early work look like a Scorcese film by comparison. Not that better camera placement would have helped the drab, absolutely non creepy environments the flick was shot in. Oh, and if you're going to shoot a film in Super 8, don't bother adding computer graphics. Special effects on a lower par than those of a Sci-Fi Channel original series just make a crappy film look crappier. In Dead Life, zombies start appearing with no real explanation. One of them falls into the lake, and suddenly it's a nationwide epidemic. The only hope for a small band of white trash misfits is a guy who mainly just drinks beer in front of a half built house he claims to be working on. The script is terrible. The acting, even the zombie acting, is downright embarrassing. Everyone in Dead Life talks like they've only been awake for ten minutes. Have you ever tried to talk to somebody after they wake and bake? If so, you can imagine what the communication in this film is like. Not only is Dead Life poorly made, it fails to make any kind of sense. How can a zombie falling into a lake contaminate the whole continent? Who would find a zombie eating one of their neighbors and then casually start f#@king it in the ass? Come to think of it, what kind of person would let anyone, living or dead, get their mouth anywhere near their genitals after seeing that same person gnawing raw human flesh right off the bone? Give horror fans a break! We're sick, we're not stupid! Dead Life managed to almost bore me to death and insult my intelligence at the same time. This piece of crap deserves nothing but ridicule and disdain."
0,"This is the first time I have commented on a film because I felt that if the right person read it, they might wake up and do something about it. Over the last few months, ABC Family began airing a new format of movies. I have seen the last three and enjoyed them. They were engaging and did the trick. My wife likes these films. I was looking forward to viewing ""See Jane Date"". The trailers looked and sounded great. Unfortunately, this is one film where the book must be light years ahead of the effort displayed by the writers and music people involved with this project. The year is 2003, the source (all bad), the score was as interesting as an elevator ride in a department store. It was intrusive and did not add any emotional content to the film at all. It worked against it. I work in the business of film and television . I enjoy being entertained. This is one instance where I kept thinking could it get any worse. The script had lines from another decade and I know these women can act but you wouldn't know it from this movie. To add to the overall experience, the end left me shaking my head. An advice to the executives at Disney, ABC , ABC Family and the producers: Under any circumstances please do not hire the composer or music supervisor to do any of your future films. They have lost their touch and they need to understand what the word ""contemporary"" , ""present day"" and ""current"" means when describing a romantic comedy. There is a world passing you by. All in all a huge disappointment from folks at Von Zerneck-Sertner and ABC Family."
0,"Störtebeker is truly one of the worst TV mini-series ever made on this planet.  The acting is unbearable and the historic background is mostly nonsense: Just two examples: Visby was shown as a village of three houses. Instead, it was a major city at this time, it's best days already passed by. Secondly, Hamburg would have never been the city taking care of pirates in the Baltic Sea. Hamburg had no access to the Baltic Sea, the major town at that time was Lübeck.  But worse than all that: The directing! How can a dilettante like this guy be allowed to direct a movie like this? Impossible! There was not a single believable scene it, the fights were ridiculous and I could not suppress laughter at most stern scenes.  I can't understand at all how a major television station could be so incompetent."
2,"Steven Soderbergh is a talented director, and I respect his decision to do a low-budget picture, but this movie didn't do it for me. I am a firm believer that visuals take a back seat to script, when it comes to making a good movie. You can shoot a feature-length movie on a home video camera with bad lighting, and it can still be good as long as the script is well-written and the characters are engaging. In this case, the characters aren't engaging. First off, it's harder to make an interesting film about wealthy Hollywood types. It's better to make movies about ordinary people, with whom the audience can relate. I just felt distant from these characters, and I found it hard to get wrapped up in their lives. The director throws the audience a couple of curve balls, but they come off as more pretentious than nifty.   The film's strong points lie in its concepts, but the execution is poor. I like the idea of an ensemble of A-list actors working for little money, and not having the luxury of trailers or craft service. The ensemble cast of popular film and TV actors is definitely talented, but good acting can't save bad material. One of the reasons why I was interested in seeing the movie is because I heard that all the dialogue is improvised by the actors. Well, either I heard wrong or I was lied to, because in the DVD commentary (which is very good, by the way) Soderbergh explains that only the scenes between Nicky Katt and Enrico Colantoni are heavily improvised.   If you want to see a better film that uses a similar style of filmmaking in a more successful way, watch Mike Figgis's ""Timecode."" That film is all improvised and shot on video in real time. In that case, the experiment was a success. I'm not a big fan of experimental films in general, because in most cases the directors are simply being self-indulgent and pass their work off as high art, simply because they're being different (or ""revolutionary,"" as the more pretentious directors phrase it). Hell, making a whole movie that centers on an hour and 30 minutes of a fat slob watching TV is something different, but who would watch it? There's nothing wrong with being artistic in the process of making a film, but you must make the material at least somewhat interesting to the audience or it's simply cinematic masturbation. There are more self-indulgent films out there than ""Full Frontal,"" but this just wasn't my cup of tea. If the script were good, I wouldn't even notice the poor visual quality, but since it wasn't, I was able to notice it and as a result it hampered the film.   My score: 4 (out of 10)"
0,"I happen to be the director's nephew. It's taken me years to get my hands on a copy of this film and I can confirm that it is indeed one of the worst movies of all time. My uncle doesn't even have a copy of it anymore (I asked). I'm looking forward to bringing him a copy.  Currently the film's average rating is 1.9/10. As far as I can tell, that should put it somewhere in the mid-30s in the IMDb ""bottom 100,"" however with only 206 votes, it hasn't yet placed.  It's sad that the film doesn't even get the respect of a bottom 100 title.  Anyhow, I'm giving copies of the movie to family members this year for holiday gifts. Best/Worst gift ever?"
1,"Ms Patty Duke's story about her life and struggles with manic depression were just like my life struggles. I saw myself acting out just like her. I was so amazed at the similarities of our lives to include the sexual abuse that we both endured as children.  I saw the movie when it first premiered in 1990 and I have loved this movie so much. Anyone who has struggled with manic depression could get so much from this movie. Never mind about if it showed her awards or what they were for. That is not the issue here. The issue is how Ms Duke had an illness and fought to survive it and overcame. Ms. Duke has much to be proud of in her accomplishments with her struggles for survival of a disease that often leaves many victims without hope.  Unless a person has struggled with this illness personally they don't know the hell they have to live with. The movie to me was a success because it showed the real issues and how a person who is depressed and manic acts. It was so real...so, so, real. It was like watching myself up there on screen.  I wish I could thank Ms. Patty Duke in person for having the courage to let the public know about her illness. Bocka"
2,"This is further proof that the films Troma distributes are far better than the films they make themselves. Don't be fooled by the cover depicting a ""Rambo""-style bloodbath. This is a grim and harrowing portrait of a Vietnam vet's hell. Sure, the production values aren't great, but they add to the raw feel of the film. This isn't a film that'll uplift you (with the exception of feeling happy this isn't your life depicted). However, it is a powerful if impoverished film that must be seen.  There isn't much explicit violence for the first hour or so (with the exception of some Vietnam flashbacks). It depicts a veteran roaming the streets trying to make money yet maintain a sense of morality. He finds it difficult to be a good human being when he looks at the scum around him. He's in debt to a local loan shark, his only friend is a junkie, his wife nags him, and his baby was deformed by agent orange. Between what he has to take and his memories of Saigon, he finally snaps at the end.  This isn't an exploitation film as many may assume. Its obvious the director wanted to create something heartfelt and realistic about the trauma experienced by vets. He couldn't get anyone to finance it except Troma, who were known for schlock such as ""Class of Nuke 'Em High"". The baby is another notable aspect. Outside of ""Eraserhead"", there isn't a more disturbing deformed child caught on camera. The ending when he finally loses (reminding one of ""Taxi Driver"") is predictable but still powerful. There are scenes however that subtly show the main character to be a multi-dimensional person with feelings. He tries to talk to a child prostitute and help her only to be attacked by her pimp. Most distressing of all is the scene in which he calls his father (who thought he died in Saigon) to ask for money. Some have criticized the Vietnam flashbacks as being painfully low budget and obviously shot in New Jersey. They certainly don't look accurate but they do have a dreamlike feel that adds to the dementia of the character. Overall, this isn't a perfect film but is a memorable one. (7/10)"
1,"""Pecker"" is a young, unknown photographer from Baltimore who becomes a big star in the public, the media and the local art scene with his pictures showing the dirty reality of all-day life just as dirty underwear or human excrements. It's a typical topic of John Waters Baltimore-based independent comedies to show the weird sides of the American way of life between political correctness fashion and conservative backlashes by exploring the backgrounds of the middle class society of his hometown.  Edward Furlong of ""Terminator 2"" fame plays Pecker, supported by Christina Ricchi, photographer Cindy Sherman, legendary Patricia Hearst and Water's long-time actress Mink Stole. Although the pacing of the plot becomes a big flaw sometimes and can't compete with the fast and furious joke attacks of Water's brilliant ""Serial Mom"", it's still has some good laughs in it and some unforgettable scenes like a former junkie-girl who became a vegetarian by sniffing peas from a vegetable dish... ""Pecker"" is a great comedy about the arrogance of the art scene, media hypes, middle-class sex angst and the strange ways of how to become a pop star without realizing it. Recommended!"
0,"*WARNING. THERE MIGHT BE SPOILERS AHEAD, IF YOU CARE.*  Okay, the basic premise of this homegrown Texas film is: College kids + spookhouse + evil magic book = scary stuff. In practice, it equals a lot of time looking at the time to see how much longer this movie is going to drag on. A bunch of frat boys, along with assorted girlfriends & volunteers, is setting up a charity haunted house. The project is being presided over by a thoroughly repellent character, whose main purpose seems to be verbally & physically assaulting as many cast members as possible. I had a hard time believing that anyone would even attempt to work with this person in any capacity: he's nothing but rude and abusive to everyone, including his girlfriend and his buddy. Regardless, the kids are visited by local character & annual pumpkin-carving champion ""Pumpkin Jack"", an elderly coot who is described as the ""Santa Claus of Halloween"", and who drops off a load of props for the house, including an ominous book that figured prominently in the irritatingly strobe-flashed prologue(where a gaggle of robed cultists get turned into stir-fry). Needless to say, some damn fool starts messing with the book, and eventually most of the costumed monsters turn into real ones, and the remaining few normal folk have to try and survive. There's some good stuff in this film, but not much: everything is shot well, and the makeup effects are decent. On the other hand, the performers either underact, or overact drastically; much of the plot makes little sense outside of a ""this happens so that can happen"" series; there is hardly any musical score to speak of, just snatches of songs throughout the film; and the movie takes an hour to actually get anywhere. That last problem is the most telling: two-thirds of the 90 minute running time is used to repeatedly set up the characters. Tom is a nice guy dating Heidi the control freak, but he used to date Jill, who is now dating Dan the jerk, but she's started a relationship Kira the girl who wears too many shawls/capes. Dan is a really big jerk, Gary likes to play jokes, and Steve & Lily like to have a lot of sex. Stuff that could have easily been dealt with in 20 minutes or so drags on and on, to the point where the lesbian ""sex"" scene(calm down, it's pretty tame) left me looking for the fast forward button. That leaves us with half an hour of lo-calorie scares, a klunky ending and a deep-seated dislike of ol' Pumpkin Jack, who I blame for the whole mess. Unless you can get this on some sort of deep-discount rental(and really have seen everything else in the store), put it back on the shelf and keep looking."
2,"If anyone wants to see what film acting is all about, watch Claudette Colbert's performance in this movie. She imprints life and humanity onto the movie screen in a timeless performance.  Orson Welles is somehow able to tone down his larger-than-life persona and give a good performance, although the makeup job he wears is not very good. George Brent proves that there is a place for his much-maligned type of acting which is fine for this type of role. Natalie Wood delivers a great child-actor performance. The orchestrated musical score is lush, dignified, old-fashioned, and appropriate.  Forget any reservations you may have about black-and-white, age of the film, or any other concerns. The sincerity of everyone involved is impressive, and rare in movies of any era."
2,"When I watch a DVD I really like to watch it from start to end without skipping anything.  With this presentation I felt like 1 hour was great, a half hour was ok, and another half hour was poor. I'm sure if I owned this DVD I'd always wish to skip by the poorer stuff.  I really liked Donny Osmond, Elaine Page, Michael Ball and the various ""Cats"" songs and the song by Boy Zone.  I was greatly irritated that they let Antonio Banderas sing the Phantom. He just does not have the voice for Phantom of the Opera. His Evita song was OK though.  There were also a couple of songs by people that I did not recognize that had very bad unmusical voices.  Sarah Brightman's voice is good but her facial expressions looked a bit odd.  DVD lovers will find the Dolby 5.1 track on the DVD sounds very flat. It feels more like Dolby 2.0 or even Dolby mono at times.  So overall I'd give it 7/10. Since the best parts can be found on Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and on Cats (both of which I own already) I don't feel compelled to buy this DVD. It is worth watching. However, I'd only recommend buying it if you don't have any of the other Andrew Lloyd Weber DVDs."
2,"""Two"" was a show on TV during the mid-90s. It was on the air, at the same time as several other late-night adventure-dramas. In fact, I thought that the 90s seemed to be the last great era of TV adventure shows. Don't know why, but I suspect folks just don't find the adventure show genre as appealing as they once did. Who knows?? I watched ""Two"" on a local syndicated station every Saturday night, and it came on after the 11:00 news. It starred hunky Michael Easton as the main character, named Gus McClain. Gus McClain was an earnest, milquetoast college professor, who led a nice, tame life.  Everything was great for Gus, until he found his wife had been suddenly murdered one day. This show had the exact same premise as the ""Fugitive"" series. Instead of chasing a one-armed culprit, Gus McClain finds that his own evil twin brother, Booth, had committed his wife's murder. And Gus vows to capture Booth, and bring him to justice.  There's just one hitch though-the FBI thinks Gus committed the crime, since they've no way of knowing that Gus has a twin brother. It gets even more complicated, when Booth kills one of the pursuing FBI agent's partner. This FBI agent then becomes insanely obsessed with capturing Gus. And she almost does, on more than one occasion during the series run. But Gus always manages to slip through her proverbial 'grasp'.  Basically the whole series is based on Gus capturing Booth, before the FBI can get Gus. Nothing new about this type of cat-and-mouse scenario. Anyone who watches TV with any frequency, has seen it all before. I'd say the only reason to watch ""Two"", is if you happen to be a Michael Easton fan. Otherwise, ""Two"" is, at best, a mediocre adventure show."
2,"It isn't necessarily a bad thing that a first time director is working from a script with first time writers; I've seen worse films where a first time director wrote the script. However, this film would have been better served by either some more experience (or polish) on the writing end and, probably, with a director who was willing to make the necessary changes.  For example, when the Noseworthy character admits to his ""best friend"" that he too, slept with her dead boyfriend, it seems pointless and isn't and doesn't go anywhere, not even to an ""I'm sorry for hurting you, Izzy"" comment from Noseworthy's Anthony character.   The beginning of the film, where the young man walks away from the Anthony character's bed exists purely to show the character would be petulant because guys walk out on him after sleeping with him -- so when the Henry Kray character does it, of course, he needs revenge by messing up the Henry's entire life.   These elements are just so predictable or undeveloped as to ruin the opportunity the film has to be something new or unique.  Even the basic story, since it's one that has been the plot of a few trashy trade paperback gay novels and even the plot of a few trashy 'JO' (since IMDb doesn't like the more precise verbiage) stories in gay male adult magazines, needed more development than it got. I actually felt Karen Allen's performance was good, although the accent was a bit jarring. Unfortunately, too much time was spent developing her character for too little pay off. If she was going to walk away from the Senator at the end and the Senator and his son haven't reconcile, what happened to her, especially if he won re-election? Too much time is also spent with the Izzy character, especially in context with the Senator's wife, since again, there is no pay-off.  And while getting drunk and having coffee is certainly the way for a relationship to begin, there was nothing on screen to justify Noseworthy doing this, especially since they don't end up together in the end.  If the director couldn't see the flaws in the script and fix them, he was the major problem. If the writers didn't realize these kinds of problems, they need a good editor. As it was, I gave the movie a better mark than I normally might for trying something different than you might normally see in a gay movie and for good performances by the leads, who were undermined by the script and clearly did the best they could with their dialog and situations, and didn't make them any worse. Hopefully, both will get better roles (or make better decisions about the roles they take) in the future."
2,Story of an ex-Navy Seal who is now a combat medical officer assigned to a state of the art Russian sub with a nurse. This is to answer a call for help set off by a dying member of the original crew. The sub has been overtaken by terrorists who are bent on destruction. So we see the duo try and gain control back. And this happens with the fear of the US Naval Forces is about to unleashing everything it has got on the terrorist sub to prevent it from launching its arsenal. Be careful of the early explicit sexual scene in the first quarter of the movie. A couple of unexplained scenes towards the end. Watch it when you have the time. Nothing to miss out even if you let the show run while you go get yourself a cup of coffee: slow moving.
0,"This is the first Guinea Pig film from Japan and this is the sickest, in my opinion. A bunch of guys torture a girl for several days before finally killing her. And at this point, I will say that these films are NOT real! They are faked horror films which try to be as realistic as possible.  The scenes are sickening but also unrealistic in many cases. For example, when they kick the girl in the floor, we can clearly see how they kick and stump the floor near the girl! And how stupid this looks! The sound effects are also unrealistic and don't make sense. Other scenes include animal intestines thrown on the girl, the girl exposed to loud noises for many hours, the ripping off of fingernails, worms placed on the wounds in the girl's body, the eye pierced and mutilated in horrific detail and stuff like that. Very sick and mean spirited film and has absolutely nothing valuable or cinematically significant. This first entry is the sickest and most amateurish Guinea Pig, although it is not as bloody as the next part, Flowers of Flesh and Blood, which tries to be as shocking as possible.  Guinea Pig: Devil's Experiment is perhaps the sickest thing I've seen and the closest thing to snuff there is. This is still (of course) faked s(n/t)uff, the only difference to genuine ""snuff film"" is that no one dies or hurts for real in this film. I cannot recommend this to anyone since thi s is so s****y and repulsive. They who consider this is a great horror film understand nothing about cinema and the real meaning of it. I watched this as a curiosity (as the other parts in the series) and now I know how insignificant trash these are. They work only in shock level and that's not too valuable cinematic achievement. Devil's Experiment is perhaps the sickest film I've seen and Mermaid in a Manhole (Guinea Pig 4) is perhaps the most disgusting film I've seen. So these are pretty extreme in my book, but that's all they are."
2,"Out of the several hundred Westerns in my DVD collection, this one has to be the very worst. Totally incompetent. Hittleman must have been a better salesman than a movie maker to have even managed to raise what little money would have been needed to make this awful mess. It's devoid of even the campy charm that Ed Wood might have put into it. Wills, Downs, Holloway, & Cagney must have been hurting for money to have agreed to appear in something this bad. Released in 1956, the same year as George Stevens' Giant, Chill Wills must have been been rather amazed to find himself in two such different movie productions in the same year. I only wish that I could get back the time I wasted watching this trash."
2,"I'm sure everyone can remember the first time they saw Bambi, I'm also sure that most of you have cried while watching Bambi, it's one of Disney's most touching films. So I got to see Bambi 2, while normally we have a million Disney sequels that are major disappointments, but Bambi 2 surprised me, it was very well done and was nicely put together. I really enjoyed the animation, the voices, the story, they were really lovely. The one flaw that comes into sequels is how different the voices are from the previous film, despite that you can still notice a difference, Bambi 2 fits the voices very well for the characters. I also enjoyed this new chapter into Bambi's life as he is learning how to become a prince, but still holding onto his childhood and his favorite friends.  Bambi is having a hard time, his father has to take care of him but his father also has no respect for him since Bambi isn't as brave as he is. Bambi will do anything to just get his father's respect, with the help of some old friends like Thumper and Flower, he'll try his best to over come his fear and be a brave prince. But he's got a new enemy, a mean fawn, Ronno, who constantly teases him about his flaws. Bambi is also having to learn how to grieve the death of his mother and make sure that he doesn't meet the same fate as she did.  Bambi 2 is a definite recommendation, it's a different Disney sequel than I've ever seen because it seems like this one could have been in the theaters. It's very well done and just a total pleasure to watch, wither it's by yourself or with the family. I loved the return of Thumper, it's always a pleasure to see him on screen, I loved when he was trying to show Bambi's father that Bambi could be brave, but Bambi needed more time, so Thumper does his best to distract Bambi's dad, it was so cute and funny. This was a good movie to watch, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.  7/10"
0,"This would've been a *great* silent film. The acting really is good, at least in a Look Ma, I'm Doing Really Big Acting! sort of way.  Everything is HUGE. Every line is PROFOUND! Every scene is SHATTERED BY HUMAN TRAGEDY!  Mostly, I felt like gagging. Yet, like any train wreck, I couldn't tear my eyes away. This dialogue might've worked on the stage, although I doubt it. On the screen, it was cluttered, haphazard, hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work.  If you enjoy your melodrama in huge, heaping doses, you *might* enjoy the movie. Be prepared to wait, however. For all that melodrama, this thing sure plods along at its own pace.  This script must've sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves. It simply doesn't work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camera.  IMDB does us a great disservice, at times, when it uses its goofy computer-controlled ""weighted score"". Curse of the Starving Class deserves less than a 1.  Character-driven fiction is great, but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution, it isn't character development! Your characters must have a motivation. Being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is *not* character development. That's a plot contrivance.  Stay away from this movie. Or at the very least, watch it muted. Perhaps you'll get some amusement from all the arm-waving the characters do.  Oh, and word to the wise -- to prove that this is truly an artsy film, you see James Woods in all his dangly male ""look-at-me, I'm-the-figurative-and-literal-representation-of-the-naked-vulnerability-of- man"" glory.  Don't say you weren't warned."
1,"As part of the celebration of the release of Casino Royale, this film with the new Bond starring in it was shown, from director Roger Michell (Notting Hill). I almost turned it off for being a bit boring, but I'm glad I stuck with it. Basically May (Anne Reid) is a single mother of Helen (Anna Wilson-Jones) who hardly sees anyone and has not had a boyfriend in years. Her daughter says that she might want to get married to her new boyfriend, Darren (Daniel Craig, of course). After knowing each other only a few days, May and Darren have a secret affair. And at her age, with a 30-something, and the new Bond?! Anyway, they obviously want to keep it a secret, but May has regrets and wonders if Helen will find out. When she does, Darren gets less hassle than May. In fact, Helen asks her permission to hit her. Also starring Peter Vaughan as Toots, Danira Govich as Au Pair, Harry Michell as Harry, Rosie Michell as Rosie and Johnny English's Oliver Ford Davies as Bruce. Very good!"
2,"Perhaps the first south Asian film that has had such a lasting impression on me, Khamosh Pani has hardly received the glory it truly deserves. Watching the film leaves you senseless for about half an hour and then it knocks all the wind out of you.  Khamosh Pani takes the viewer to a small village in Pakistan where life evolves. Specifically it focuses on Ayesha and her son Saleem and their relationship. Ayesha never goes to the village well to draw water while Saleem gets seduced by Islamic fundamentalists and transforms from a love sick puppy to the man he thinks he wants to be.  Sabiha Sumar, perhaps one of the best directors in the subcontinent, tells us the story of a small village in Pakistan. With perhaps one of the most powerful issues to deal with, Sumar displays true genius by making everything seem so subtle and hauntingly real. Perhaps, the greatest strength lies in convincing the audience that the statement need not be made in black and white and in this respect Sumar shines.  To say that the acting performances were excellent would be the understatement of the century. One watches in amazement at how real and authentic each character is. The mind knows that what it sees are actors and yet it refuses to believe what it knows. Every single character, from an extra to the leads adds to the tremendous energy that the film brings with it. Kirron Kher as Ayesha/Veero is stunning, so much so that one cannot imagine her as anyone else. Aamir Ali Malik is another actor who plays with the audience, seducing them and disturbing them through the course of the film As an Indian separated from the partition by two generations I can't really say that I feel the pain that my mother does when she sees a film such as this, I have heard stories of my grand aunt who was attacked and mutilated by a mob in Lahore when my mothers family had to leave for India. Perhaps my lack of sentimental attachment makes me see it a little more objectively. Khamosh Pani has exposed me to some of this pain and while it may not be my own I can feel it. But the question that arose in my mind is that those that were around when this bloodshed (on both sides) occurred have mostly died or are dying, will we succeeding generations ever know this pain? The pain of leaving behind a wife, killing your own daughter, leaving her to be raped, Living in another country when that which was once a part of you lives somewhere else. How can I fight for this when I don't know what its like? Khamosh Pani made me feel this pain for a few days; perhaps we need more reminders such as these so that we can experience the pain to forget."
1,"Scott Henderson, the engineer that employs Carol Richman, as his assistant, makes a point to call her ""Kansas"", whenever he speaks to her. It shows us that Carol, effectively played by Ella Raines, is supposed to be a babe in the woods, as far as the Manhattan of the 40s was concerned. Only a woman, from out of town, would follow the shady bartender to a solitary elevated subway. Even then, only a naive girl could undertake such an adventure.  Robert Siodmak directed this film noir very well. He shows a flair for infusing the story with a lot of raw sex that was surprising for those days. How else could we justify the way the drummer in the orchestra of the musical, where Scott takes the mysterious woman with an unusual hat, makes such an overt pass at a lady on a date? The drummer played with high voltage by Elisha Cook Jr. doesn't hide his desires for any of the ladies who sat in the front row of the hit musical where he plays. It was a real explicit invitation, first to the ""phantom woman"" of the story, Fay Helm; afterward, Cliff the drummer, insinuates himself very openly to Ella Raines who goes to the theater disguised as the mystery dame her boss had taken originally.  This is a film that will hook any viewer from the beginning. There are things not explained in it, but it holds the one's interest throughout. The killer is not revealed until the end.   Ella Raines with her expressive eyes was an under estimated actress. She holds her own against much more experienced actors. Franchot Tone, a New York stage actor, working in Hollywood, never found in this medium the fame he deserved. He is effective as the accused man's best friend. On the other hand, Alan Curtis, comes across as a man, who when framed, accepts his fate and is saved only by the tenacity of the woman who secretly loved him. Thomas Gomez, as the inspector Burgess, is an asset to the film as a detective who has his doubts the police had caught the man who committed the crime.  This movie will not disappoint."
2,"Largely disappointing film which does a terrible job of accounting the shocking and brutal murder of a young newly married New Hampshire man at the hands of his wife's school boy lover and his teenage friends.  Neither Joyce Chopra nor her screen writing team have made any attempt to emotionally involve their audience, and any attention to the details of this tragic case is completely non-existent, thus leaving the viewers frustrated and starved of information.  The entire cast are all very ordinary and uninspiring which results in a potentially fascinating and aggravating true story (although claimed to be fictitious in the end credits) becoming an uninteresting drag. Watch an old ""Colombo"" re-run instead!  Thursday, August 4, 1994 - T.V."
2,"Par for the course, regarding Troma films. Got a few chuckles from me just out of pure silliness, but it's a one-joke comedy movie with some action and cartoon sound effects thrown in for good measure. Not the worst, but I didn't have a good feeling about myself after watching this movie in it's entirety."
2,"""The Exorcist"" made you feel respect and fear to the Devil. Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead II"" makes fun of the Devil and demon possession. Although there are some really scary scenes, there are some really twisted funny situations that would leave you wondering ""what the f*** just happened?!"". The movie is funny for the wrong reasons. I eventually don't laugh about when a man is breaking himself dishes on the head. I don't think it's funny when a man is repeatedly beaten up by grotesque characters. I would never imagine a man getting eaten by a demon locked under a cellar and throwing gallons of blood! ""Evil Dead II"" makes it look hilarious in a wicked kind of way. For example, when Linda's head tells Ash that ""she is being tormented, and suffering in hell; you can feel a little scared but the next scene has a corpse without a head holding a chainsaw. There's no time for logic here, just sit and enjoy!  It also has the ability to make you feel tense and I must say, scared. The combination of demon possessed people, EVIL sounds (I love the weird noise in the movie), wicked laughs and chanting (""dead by dawn!""), and intrepid camera angles are the perfect ingredients to make a sui generis Horror-Comedy movie. Watch out for the ""A Farewell to Arms"" joke, the whole situation with the evil hand, and the eye that gets in a woman's mouth!.  Sam Raimi went too far for the good reasons. He created an unbelievable and unforgettable work that has served as inspiration for many movies in recent years. The movie is easily one of the most visually stunning Horror movies of all time, for sure. Die hard fans of gore get an eye candy for an hour and a half. Raimi created a cult movie in all the sense of the world. ""Groovy!"". ""Dead by Dawn"" will never bore you because in every scene there's a feeling of uncertainty and that makes it even more interesting. There are no rules here.   The plot is as scary as you can imagine but it's held in such a way that it isn't taken very seriously. I mean, demon possession caused by the Necronomicon is something that happens in the real world. Not exactly with that book but it can happen via satanic books and rituals. Raimi takes it to a different level of humor mixed with gore.   Bruce Campbell deserves a special mention. He delivers a wicked, solid, and totally believable performance. Something you haven't seen before mainly because of the strange situations he goes through. His performance could be described as a ""solo"". Easily, one of the best performances of any actor in a Horror movie. Also, one of the characters that suffers the most in any movie! Ash is beaten up by demons, humans, objects, etc. Even possessed creatures make fun of him.   The gore here is great, glorious. You get decaps, mutilated bodies, a hand cut off, bleeding demons, etc. Blood spread all over the cabin is the common denominator. One of the goriest movies of all time.   Watch ""Evil Dead II"" to witness one of the most creative, brave, and goriest movies of all time. It delivers something for everyone. It has action, gore, spectacular camera angles, and some action! Check out Ash V.S. possessed Henrietta. * After it, phrases like ""join us!"", ""swallow this!"", and specially ""groovy!"" will be part of your daily vocabulary.   Recommended for every Horror fan in the world. This movie is an obligation to watch."
0,"Any movie that has nude scenes of Karen Allen and I'm still so bored I walk out, that is a stinker!   Karen gets stuck in Paris, and befriends a sissily-handsome French man with whom she is having sex soon. Of course he's married, (""But, cheri, why should that be a problem?"") What could be an interesting clash of cultures is (believe it or not) just dull. I walked out.   Maybe the movie got a lot better after I left; but it would have had to have gotten a LOT better to make up for a rotten beginning.  My advice, if you find yourself in this, run, do not walk, for the exit. Save your time and your energy. Most assuredly save your money. It's a shame the production company didn't save its money."
2,"James Grodin's Character of Lenny in ""The Heartbreak Kid"" is one of the most peculiar characters you'll likely encounter on film. Despicable, outrageous and an audacious liar. He's obnoxious in his determination to get what he thinks he wants and yet somehow comes across as sincere and likable. This whole film is also one of the most peculiar comedies to come along. I found myself alternating between laughs and uncomfortable winces at his utter insensitivity and selfish determination, but it's this dichotomy of emotions that make The Heartbreak Kid the obscure gem that it is. I don't think we can ever be sure if we should like or hate this guy. Two scenes in this movie: ""laying his cards on the table"" over drinks with Kelly and her parents and the breakup scene in the restaurant with Lila, are a sight to behold. Eddie Albert's, Jeannie Berlin's and Cybill Shepherd's facial expressions are priceless as they listen to Lenny's plans to claim Kelly after remedying his current ""complication"". The scene in the restaurant as Lenny tries to ""drop the bomb"" on Lila would be funny if it wasn't so painful to watch. I've never been quite sure about the final scene of this movie: Lenny on the couch, quietly humming to himself, seemingly at a loss as the camera lingers on him for a thoughtful moment, is he already on his way to becoming dissatisfied again now that he has attained his desire or has he finally found some peace after his battle for Kelly? This is an unusual comedy well worth a look. If you can find it."
2,"The truth is that about 80% of the people who see (have seen) this movie won't like it. Why? Because it is not that original. But in saying that, I happen to belong to the 20% who really like it.  I first saw it back in the eighties when I was about 8 or 9 years old. Now almost 20 years on I saw it again, and it really brought back nostalgic memories from when I was a kid.  Some people say this movie has bad acting. I don't agree at all. While the story might not be the best ever, there is definitely nothing wrong with the acting. And the supersonic Maiden One plane looks absolutely stunning, even though it is 70's B-TV-movie material.  I really recommend it to fans of disaster movies. It is hard to get a hold of these days, but if you have a chance to see it, do so."
0,"I watched this a few days ago, so details are getting hazy. The film is shot on hand-held cameras, and a lot was made of this at the time it was released originally, since we hadn't had many studio pictures made in this way. I can't help but feel this was more of a gimmick than anything, designed to make the audience think that what we are seeing on the screen hasn't had all the compromises that come with a big budget, and so was more ""real"". However what we have here isn't much more than a not-as-good rip off of the first half of Full Metal Jacket, so anyone who has seen that, or any one of the other rip offs there of, will know what to expect.  The main problem I had was the stereotyped characters, with the weedy soft kids out of their depth, close harmony singing, Ebonics spouting black dudes, world weary sergeants, bitter and twisted psychos etc etc... all being put into the sorts of situations that would provide the most friction and tension at any given time. Maybe this was intentional to highlight the stupidity and injustice of the situation, maybe it was laziness, or maybe it was just a committee trying to appeal to the biggest audience, all I know is it was annoying. One novel thing was the mixture of volunteers and draftees (where normally all the characters would have been forced into the situation,) although only the scenes between the two main characters really make much play of it. This seems to be the main pivot of the plot, with the volunteers coming to their senses and the draftees gaining a sense of duty and self worth, but its all done in a rather forced and unsubtle way. The other big bug I had was how all the characters (with the exception of the psychos and the real softies) would react to each inevitable conflict with at first aggression and threats of violence, faced with Farrell's ubiquitous stoicism, immediately back down and be all reasonable and diplomatic.  I guess if I had to find a plus it would be the acting from the two leads, which was strong and very convincing, tho considering the formulaic nature of the characters, this wasn't too hard.  In my imagination, Bozz grew up to be Zeke off Tour of Duty, and for my money, 4 episodes of that would be more fun to watch."
2,"This is one of the most transparent and heavy handed pieces of propaganda ever disguised as a horror movie.  Earth spirits defending themselves by literally reaching out and attacking humans has been a left wing wet dream for a long time and it was only a matter of time before it hit the movie screen.  I could overlook the politics if it wasn't so monumentally boring, silly, and full of stereotypes. Once again, Ron Perlman is cast as a loud ignorant right winger, his vaguely simian cranial features a big asset to the role I'm sure, while ""Good guy"", James Legros is as bland as usual, with a nastier than usual beard.  Can you imagine being the love interest and getting into a love triangle with these two puke faces?  Larry (what's his face) the director and star of Habit, the most boring vampire movie ever, should take a lesson from those commie spaghetti westerns and at least let us have some fun."
0,"This film is another of director Tim Burton's attempts to capitalize on a familiar title to bring his `vision' to the screen. He has done it with `Batman', `Sleepy Hollow' and now this. This is not a remake. The only thing it has in common with the original is that it has simians that can speak (and Charleton Heston makes a cameo). Burton has reconstituted the entire story, watering it down for today's mass viewership.  The original Planet of the Apes was a product of its time. During the 1960's America was struggling to redefine its civilization. It was a turbulent time of soul searching and rethinking social norms. It was the civil rights era where groups long considered inferior demanded to be treated as equal. In that context, POTA was allegorical, reflecting the philosophical turmoil confronting the audiences of the day. POTA was an extremely intelligent film that broached difficult questions and elegantly held the oppressions of American society up to scrutiny by making the white guy justify his intelligence to a species he considered inferior. The dialectic between Colonel Taylor (Charleton Heston), Dr. Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) was thought provoking and intelligent with ironies both subtle and obvious.  Burton's version is as much a product of today's times as POTA was of the sixties. This is Apes for Dummies. It is superficial and jejune, substituting politically correct platitudes for intelligent dialogue and focusing more on form than substance. The `surprise' ending is utterly incongruous and contributes nothing to the film except a cliffhanger that sets up the sequel. While the ending of the original POTA gracefully tied everything together in a single powerful scene, Burton's ending simply mocks the audience, taunting, `I know something you don't know, and you are going to have to wait for the sequel to find out.'  From a technical perspective, as is always the case with Burton's film, the film is excellent. The makeup is fantastic and Burton's camerawork is outstanding (though I continue to dislike his dark look). However, thirty-three years of advancements in prosthetic makeup can not compensate for the insultingly vacuous script.  The story has been reduced to a monster movie. The humans band together behind Captain Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) to fight the monstrous Apes, aided and abetted by a few turncoats (notably Helena Bonham Carter as Ari). The presentation is formulaic and simplistic with plenty of violence, perfect for today's fast food mentality.  The acting is mixed. Mark Wahlberg is a fine actor who is simply miscast in this role. Walberg is excellent at playing dark, sullen characters that are tormented but strong. This part requires an inspirational hero, a profile not in Wahlberg's repertoire. Helena Bonham Carter is a brilliant actor whose character is so far beneath her ability that the disconnect is laughable. She tries desperately to do something with the flimsy character, but her interpretation presents like a cross between a college peace demonstrator and love sick teenager.  Then there is Tim Roth. His is a virtuoso performance, single-handedly saving the film from total ruin. Roth is diabolically hateful as the malevolent General Thade. He creates one of the most villainous and despicable bad guys I can remember in some time. Additionally, his physical acting is superlative, rendering a chimp-man that is such a perfect meld that one can almost believe that the species exists.  This film is a great disappointment. It is decent entertainment, as long as you check your brain at the door. I rated it a 3/10. From a technical perspective it is much better than that, perhaps a 9/10. However the story is an insult to the original franchise. It is simply another attempt by Burton at self adulation, using a familiar title to attract throngs to the box office so lots of people can see what a genius he is. Of course it's true, but it would be great if he used that talent to produce substantial films, instead of simple minded pap formulated for mass consumption."
2,"Many years ago this reviewer subscribed to fantasy-horror magazine 'Starburst', then in its infancy and rivalling 'Fangoria' for its lurid colour photos of blood, guts and exploding latex. One such issue covered new release The Monster Club, and to this 10-year-old it looked utterly brilliant, with its gallery of werewolves, vampires and ghouls. There was even a woman with a melty face!   Yet if pre-teens had actually been allowed to see it, they might have found it less impressive. The monster masks alone, fashioned by freelance designer Vic Door, who also worked at a milk processing plant, are laughable when compared with those from the Mos Eisley Cantina just three years before - lending understandable succour to the myth that they were made by producer Milton Subotsky's milkman.  Amicus Studio's death-rattle, and a homage to the 1970s glory years of its portmanteau horrors, if The Monster Club has accrued a certain cult status it's mostly down to its sheer awfulness; yet, bafflingly, The Monster Club, adapted from Chetwynd-Hayes' 1976 novel of the same name, does in fact boast a highly experienced and occasionally impressive pedigree.  In director Roy Ward Baker it had the man behind cult horrors like The Legend Of The Seven Golden Vampires, The Vault Of Horror, Asylum - and, most famously, Quatermass And The Pit. As a screenwriter, Amicus co-founder Subotsky had also penned a number of culty items, including I, Monster and Dr Terror's House Of Horrors. Cinematographer Peter Jessop had shot the schlocky likes of Frightmare, Venom and Schizo. But most importantly, it stars a real horror triumvirate of greatness:- Vincent Price, John Carradine and Donald Pleasence - along with veterans from past Amicus films Britt Ekland and Geoffrey Bayldon (here reprising an earlier role as an asylum keeper).  This may have been made in 1980, but tonight they're going to party like it's 1973. To a frightful new wave soundtrack supplied by UB40 and BA Robertson who sings ""I'm just a sucker for your love."" Oh yes, a strange concoction indeed. But ranged against the likes of classic Amicus anthologies such as From Beyond The Grave (another Chetwynd-Hayes miscellany) even its dubious cult status is unwarranted - although the song ""Monsters Rule OK"" is pleasingly jaunty, and you do get to see Vincent Price and John Carradine disco dancing.  In keeping with the Amicus tradition, the film features a handful of not-very-creepy tales, plus a 'comedy' story for light relief, linked by a story-within-a-story - here played out between Price's vampire Eramus (his fangs are retractable when not in use) and horror writer Chetwynd-Hayes himself, played by Carradine. After necking his favourite author, Eramus ferries him to his members club by way of an apology, where they're subjected to forgotten new wave bands (""down at the monster club/a zombie and a ghoul can do the monster dub""), along with ""every kind of monster you could ever imagine... and some far beyond the imagining of mere mortals"" - which is just not true, unless you're actually incapable of imagining a one pound joke shop mask.  Price also inducts him into the arcane mysteries of monster genealogy, handily illustrated on a wall-chart (scroll away at leisure): ""A vampire and a werewolf would produce a werevamp, but a werewolf and a ghoul would produce a weregoo. But a vampire and a ghoul would produce a vamgoo. A weregoo and a werevamp would produce a shaddy. Now, a weregoo and a vamgoo would produce a maddy, but a werevamp and a vamgoo would produce a raddy. Now, if a shaddy were to mate with a raddy or a maddy, the result would be a mock."" Once we've waded through that gibberish (and how it must have pained the eloquent and mellifluous Price to utter it) we sample the delights of a stripper who takes her performance all too literally, and are told three tales, the first and most atmospheric of which is about a 'shadmock' (the lowest on the monster food chain) who possesses a deadly whistle - the Roger Whittaker variety, not the referee's aid.  In the second, a vampire dad foils a vampire killer with... ""a stake-proof vest!"" The final story concerns a remote village of human-munching ghouls. Having convinced the author of the inherent humanity of his kind (""there is nothing sadder than the agonised grief of a tender-hearted monster""), Price counters that the 'real' monsters are humans. And to that we must add, jaded screenwriters."
1,"  One of the best films I've ever seen. Robert Duvall's performance was excellent and outstanding. He did a wonderful job of making a character really come to life. His character was so convincing, it made me almost think I were in the theater watching it live, I give it 5 stars."
0,"This is the movie that I use to judge all other bad movies, and so far there hasn't been anything close.  The only good thing I can say is that after watching this I know that I have seen the worst movie I will ever see."
2,"This is another Jean-Claude Van Damme action flick, but a definite notch above many of his other films, at least in production values. The photography and stereo sound are excellent.  Actually, this is pretty simple stuff and old storyline of a low-key good guy rescuing the girl from local meanies. Here, Van Damme defends Rosanna Arquette and her small kids.  In another respect, the movie is just another avenue for the two stars to show off their incredible bodies. Neither has ever been shy about doing that and certainly aren't in this movie. My only objection is having one of the kids make a sexual remark, which is done in here. There is no excuse for that.  Ted Levine, who has turned nice guy in the hit TV series ""Monk,"" is an effective bad guy in here. He played a lot of villains before ""Monk"" came around.  Anyway, it's fairly low-brow entertainment, but at least it is entertaining and fun to watch."
2,"Elfen Lied is presented as a series of 13+1 24 minutes episodes. Although the plot is not new (mutants that have enough power to exterminate the whole human race) the characters and the story flow are fresh and most of all very surprising. The main character is a diclonius (two-horned human) named Luci / Nyu and she have a special ability called vectors (invisible extra strong energy hands). The main plot follows the usual formula boy takes innocent girl in, falls in love with her, but there are also any complex character dilemmas. Perhaps not everyone will enjoy this anime because of the gore, blood and nudity content. But I guess it all works toward the strange horror-comedy experience. Who would've ever guessed that an innocent looking, pink-haired girl would be capable of causing such a major blood bath? You see heads being ripped off, bodies torn in half, and blood dripping everywhere. Once again if you are not comfortable with this kind of scenes, then is likely that Elfen Lied is not for you. If you liked anime like: Akira, Blood: The Last Vampire and Evangelion, you might have some fun with Elfen Lied. Perhaps, the animation is nothing out of the ordinary and if compared with the manga version it is a little bit short and the extra episode 14 does not help toward the end (is more like a retrospective episode in between 7th and 8th episode). Rate: 8.5 out of 10"
2,"I thought this film was excellent! I heard some people complaining and saw some of the complaints here on IMDb, but this film is genius. Of course it shows the same scene over and over- that is the entire premise of the movie! So for people to say that it bothered them...well, they must like more uninformative plots, i.e. Jumper.  The film starts off with a stickler of a news producer shouting off orders to camera men as the President enters for a speech at a world meeting in Spain. The President, obviously, is shot, but it was the loud and unexpected BOOM that caused me to jump. From there the story rewinds to 23 minutes earlier at 12:00. It replays from all the different vantage points several times. Seeing it over and over is not annoying, though, again, those who might prefer a less engaging story might think it is. Each time the scene rewinds we learn something new about the conference, the people attending, and where the ""gunmen"" are located. Each scene leaves you on the edge of your seat exhaling slowly as you wait for your adrenaline to slow. The ending is also so explosive and heart-pounding, I held my husband's hand with the ""grip of death"" in anticipation. This film is definitely worth the overpriced ticket at the box office. It deserves to be seen on the big screen."
2,"A trilogy of gay/lesbian stories tracing societal attitudes towards homosexuals and the homosexual lifestyle from the 1950's to the present, this is the first ""legacy"" film for gays.  Superbly written, acted and produced, the three tales revolve around the themes of prejudice and acceptance, with the middle story of a young student's ""coming out"" as an impetus for his role model teacher's lifestyle disclosure, being the standout episode and should be seen by anyone wrestling with their sexual identity.  Bravo Paramount and Showtime for this outstanding and compassionate film."
2,"Whatever you think of this misguided and silly film, please don't tell Mary Louis Parker, Billy Crudup's girlfriend, he stunk big time in this disaster because she might not like you, and hit you, the same way she hit some fan who was bad-mouthing Billy in his last stage appearance in New York.  Whatever was Cate Blanchett thinking when she accepted the title role in this stupid little number? No one can believe for a moment all the goings and comings the screenwriter has plotted at the expense of truth and reality. I'm afraid that our Cate really has to have her little head examined and maybe one day she'll fess up the real reasons for getting near this project that makes absolute no sense at all, let alone the preposterous situation which situates ""la Blanchett"" in that God forsaken little town where she sticks out like a sore thumb.   Billy Crudup is totally out of place in the company of people like Michael Gambon, or even Cate. His character is totally unbelievable and we cannot think of him as the brains behind all the work against the invading Nazi army.  Sorry Ms. Armstrong, better luck next time. We have admired your work before, but films like these are beneath your best abilities. Try to get involved in an Australian theme, one that you're more familiar with, and give us something more dignified than Charlotte Gray, who, by the way, doesn't even have to change her name at all because no one could have cared less if she was Gray, Brown, Green, Black, Blue, Black, or just plain Jane Doe!"
0,"The 60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. NBC mini-series (later released to video/DVD as full length feature film) about the treacherous 1960s, as seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family. The film's first half is driven by the excellent performance of Dutton as Reverend Willie Taylor and evenly spreads the storyline between the families. However, Dutton's character is killed halfway through and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull, incoherent, and downright awful 2nd half. RATING: 4 out of 10. Not rated (later rated PG-13 for video/DVD release)."
2,"I was in this movie. Nothing big, just ran out of a van and up some steps and that's it. A friend of mine was in a few scenes too (trips up the main character during class I think). I remember being pulled out of class and sent down to an area where many kids were lined up to see if they'd get a part. They filmed, what I guess was the city public school scenes, at my school; Alexandria Primary School in Sydney.  I can't remember much of the movie. I think a number of us went to see a screening of it over in North Sydney. We had an introduction from the cast & crew but that's about all I remember. Oh, and the ""food & drink"" they put on for us consisted of a paper cup of candy popcorn & a cup of lemonade. Ritzy! Still, it got me out of quite of bit of school that day, earned me $50 and each take of my scene (and there were a few) I had to eat an éclair. Not bad."
2,"The great Enzo G. Castellari made (in 1977) a war movie in the style of The Dirty Dozen or The Longest Day. Of course, Castellari had to add his usual tons of slapdash violence and action. This is the kind of war movie they stopped making after Vietnam, so it really has a distinct nostalgic feeling to it. QUEL MALEDETTO TRENO BLINDATO makes war out to seem really fun and exiting, contrary to other war flicks of that period such as THE DEER HUNTER or APOCALYPSE NOW. Instead, it is a harmless, exciting, even ludicrous action film. I challenge anyone to count the number of deaths in this film and send me a rough estimate! The cast was great, the acting pretty good, the action scenes well done (as usual for my man Enzo), and the music was appropriately nostalgic as well. The only thing this film doesn't have working for it, is the fact that many scenes featured the same actors dying over and over again. I found it kinda funny but some of you critics out there might just find it cheesy."
2,"As Good as it Gets is a very funny movie, filled with great acting and lines that always hit the mark p-e-r-f-e-c-t-l-y... Jack Nicholson is absolutely perfect, and Helen Hunt proves that she can do better than playing in Twister... Greg Kinnear is also very convincing in his role. The Oscar-cursed Cuba Gooding Jr. gives one of his last good performances, if not THE last one... Great movie...  85%"
2,"This series truly is awful. The scripts are tedious and repetitive. After hearing the phrase ""the child-like princess"" over and over and over again you feel a desperate need to start throwing things at the TV. You would applaud this level of performance in a school play but in anything else it's pretty unacceptable. The special effects are not too hot either, but if the scripts were better, the plots less predictable, the acting less bad and direction less clunky you would forgive any shortcomings in the level of production. It's sad to see all this effort wasted. And it's very sad to see a production cashing in on the ""Neverending Story"" name to scam a few bucks off a duped audience. With any luck I might get my money back by selling this pack of dogs on eBay."
2,"This movie was the first and best of Peter Ustinov's performances as Hercule Poirot. Though physically not very accurate to Agatha Christie's description of the little Belgian detective, for this one movie everything worked and the discrepancy was not a problem. The film is well-paced, with all the plot turns and clues coming with perfect timing, not too fast to be confusing, but not too slow to strain the rather flimsy fabric of the story. The whole cast is very good, especially Bette Davis as a malevolent old spider of a woman, gleefully tormenting her long-suffering companion, Maggie Smith. The scene where she smiles indulgently at a group of Egyptian children waving at her on the river bank, only to sink into mortified disgust as they turn around and moon her, is a highlight of the movie. The climax of the film is quite surprising, and unlike many mysteries, does not cheat the viewer by withholding vital information until the last moment. We feel the pleasure of being honestly fooled throughout, and the conclusion is thoroughly satisfying."
1,"Deanna Durbin, Nan Grey and Barbara Read are ""Three Smart Girls"" in this Universal film from 1936, which introduces Deanna Durbin to film audiences. It also stars Ray Milland, Mischa Auer, Charles Winninger, John King, Binnie Barnes and Alice Brady. It's a sweet story about three young women, now living in Switzerland with their divorced mother, who hear their father (Winninger) is marrying again. Not having seen him in 10 years and knowing their mother still loves him, they board a ship to America, with the help of the housekeeper/nanny, determined to stop the wedding. Realizing that the intended, called ""Precious"" (Barnes) is nothing but a gold-digger aided and abetted by her mother (Brady), they arrange for her to be introduced to a wealthy Count. This is arranged by their father's accountant (King). The man he chooses is a full-time drunk (Auer), but the girls mistake him for an actual wealthy count (Milland). What a mess.  This is a delightful film, not cloying or overly sugary at all, with some nice performances, particularly by Auer, Milland, Barnes and Brady. The young women are pretty and all do good work. The emphasis, of course, is on young Durbin, who is a natural actress and a beautifully-trained singer. In fact, her voice as a youngster is much more even than it would be as an adult - she has no trouble with the high notes, as she did later on because she put too much weight in the middle voice. She sings a delightful ""Il Bacio"" in a police station.  One of the nicest things about the film is to see the father, played by Charles Winninger, not want his children around - until he sees them and gets to know them. Barnes as the gold-digger isn't all that young, but the girls' mother looks way up there, so the inference probably was the older man seeking his youth with a younger, more glamorous woman. In fact, he finds the youth he was seeking in his daughters.  Universal gives Durbin the big star buildup here - she has the final shot in the movie. Ray Milland at this point was still paying his dues, and it will probably be a surprise even to film fans how young and attractive he is.  Very entertaining and of course, this led to a sequel and big stardom for Deanna."
2,"Azumi has an interesting topic however; this wonderful topic turns into a one, long boring movie. Hyper kinetic camera work is exaggerated, acting is terrible, and battles are ridiculous... Sword play is obviously better than the ones in Kill Bill but that's not enough. Kill Bill should no more be criteria for any Asian movies. There are many specific moments in this movie that requires critical acting such as the moments when Azumi's internal struggle begins. Therefore, when you watch those moments, you see nothing but a posing high school girl; no mimics, no posture, no feelings exposed, no acting. Fortunately, the film is not a waste of time for the fans of this genre. There are some astonishing fight scenes that remind Crouching Tiger & Hidden Dragon, choreography of those fight scenes are well accomplished, but it's not enough. It was not just well choreographed fight scenes that made Crouching Tiger & Hidden Dragon or Zatoichi great movies that are worth watching again and again. They all had an impressive casting and sense of enthusiasm. Azumi even lacks a comic book atmosphere, because it has a grammar school production atmosphere. Ryuhei Kitamura appears to be an amazing director regarding Aragami and Versus but in Azumi he steps back and spoils a chance. Of course, a brilliant director like him can easily recover and mend his mistakes. But it's not something very easy for young and beautiful Aya Ueto, she has a long way to go, it's better for her if she takes more acting classes..."
2,"Count Dracula (Udo Kier) is dying. He needs fresh human blood, the blood of a 'pure wirgin' as Dracula pronounces it. Dracula is to well known in Romania to be able to locate a virgin, so together with his servant Anton (Arno Juerging) he sets out to Italy to find one, because of the Italians strict religious upbringing they believe the chances of finding a virgin will be high. Upon arrival they question some locals and learn of a married couple who live nearby, the Marquis (Vittorio Di Sicca) and Marquise Di Fiore (Maxime McKendry) who have four unmarried daughters, Esmeralda (Milena Vukotic), Saphiria (Dominique Darel), Rubinia (Stefania Casini), and Perla (Silvia Dionisio). The Marquis has gambled the Di Fiore's family money away and by marrying one of their daughters off to a sick looking Dracula they think they will inherit his money when he dies. Dracula and Anton are invited to stay at their large, but run down house. Once there Dracula has the opportunity suck all the blood he needs, but thanks to Mario Balato (Joe Dallesandro) the Di Fiore's servant, some of the girls aren't as pure as Dracula needs. Before long Mario becomes suspicious of the Count, but will he find out the truth too late?  Written and directed by Paul Morrissey I was very disappointed by this extremely talky, overlong and rather dull excuse for a horror film. In fact it's more of a historical drama/sex film rather than horror. There's a lot of naked flesh and sex on show, the girls even go topless when gardening. There are only three gore scenes in the whole film, two scenes where Kier violently throws up impure blood and when Dracula is gorily killed at the end with an axe. After the funny black humour and over the top gore of Flesh for Frankenstein, which was made at the same time with some of the same cast and crew, I was expecting more of the same. Unfortunately I didn't get it. The film looks quite nice having being filmed in real historic locations in Europe and Kier is watchable as Count Dracula, as he always is. But the film just takes too long for anything interesting to happen and it becomes very boring to watch. There are very few characters in the film, once Dracula arrives at the Di Fiore's house the Di Fiore's themselves, their daughters, Mario, Dracula and Anton are the only characters seen on screen for the whole of the rest of the film. Apart from some nice scenery there is very little to recommend here for horror fans, disappointing."
2,"Silent observer sure has it right. I understand times do change but it is usually for the better! These 'stars' seem to lack some common sense when it comes to the questioning. I see the most intelligence coming from Billy. And they seem to think that every one has something sexual the in the nature of their secret. Some of the secrets have been interesting but ... I also think sometimes the 'stars' don't guess so the contestant can win the $1,000 and the dinner, i.e. the guest from Palo Cedro with the beard made of bees. The last 'star' had it made, easy but wasted time and therefore the contestant wins.Please let them find other worthwhile jobs and bring us the entertainment we deserve."
2,"When I saw this movie, I thought it was surreal. Then I moved to New York and realized that it was just being honest. The movie takes place against the colorful (sometimes to a ridiculous extent) new york artist scene. I never read the book, so I don't really know (or care) if the movie was true to it or not, but I thought that all the characters were well developed and gave some hilarious performances. The plot flowed seamlessly and by the end you know that, despite the fact that little of what you saw made much sense, there is some strange order to the world and that it's all good. I find myself recommending this movie to all my friends as I would recommend it to anyone interested in New York, art, or the simultaneous crappiness and lovableness of humanity."
2,"This is a really great action movie starring the master himself, Gary Daniels. The movie has lots and lots of action scenes. The fighting scenes are GREAT. Daniels delivers, and shows us that he is one of the best martial artists actors out there. Just keep in mind that, despite this being a Daniels-movie, there aren't that many fight scenes in it. But there's much action, for example a really long car chase scene, and shooting as well. Pretty standard action-plot, but that's exactly what action fans want in a movie like this. People who think otherwise should watch a crappy drama movie instead. Verdict: 7 stars out of 10. Well deserved."
2,"""The Haunted Mansion"" is the latest movie to be based upon an attraction at the Disney theme parks. It stars Eddie Murphy as Jim Evers, a workaholic real estate agent who finds himself and his family trapped in a mansion infested with ghosts. The movie doesn't rank as well as ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" The story isn't all that it should be. But the movie does have its good points. The art direction is beautiful, and there are plenty of visual gems. The ghosts seen in the graveyard are probably the best part of the movie. Terence Stamp puts in a suitably creepy performance as Ramsley, the butler, and Jennifer Tilly is kooky as Madame Leota. ""The Haunted Mansion"" is no ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" but it is still worth a look."
2,"Awesome blend of love and suspense. A top class thriller with Al-Pacino at his best. A record ""Sea of Love"" is played in all the crime scenes.. All the victims were killed after sex... The police suspects the hands of a woman.. The Investigation officer, Frank Keller(Al-Pacino) finds himself in love with a prime suspect. As they get closer he finds more clues to suspect her. Every time he was sure she did it, he finds his suspicions baseless... One day Keller finds the the list of all victims in his love's house along with the ""Sea of Love"" record. Story goes through twists and turns... The movie will put the viewers at the last inch of their seat."
1,"Actually one particular person/character isn't ""right there"", but my summary line is referring to the power of the movie. And this is all achieved without any fancy camera moves and/or big production sets, but with a great story and very (believable) and good actors conveying the story (arc).  You could call it a companion piece to great japan movies/cinema (such as Tokyo Story etc.), not so much story-wise of course, but more mood-wise! Great acting, nuances in the performances that are truly gems. If you're eager to experience a touching story and want to see a movie touching you emotionally, than this is the one to go. As you have noticed (as with many of my reviews), I'm not getting into the story. There are places here at IMDb where you can look those up, I'm not one to spoiler the story whatsoever!"
2,"On the trail of the once stolen and now missing ""Nardo Diamonds"", police woman Lee Hamilton (Carole Mathews) infiltrates the female members of said gang behind prison walls. Planning a jail break, she accompanies Beverly Garland, Marie Windsor and Jil Jarmyn into the swamps of Louisiana's bayou country where the gems are hidden. Along the way, the quartet runs into Mike Connors and his little bayou baby Marie (Susan Cummings) by way of the Mardi Gras. Marie earns her status as a gold digging, whiny opportunist, so that by the time she's attacked by an alligator, you wind up rooting for the reptile.  ""Swamp Women"" doesn't appear to be much more than an opportunity for director Roger Corman to put shapely women in cut off shorts on display in a lush tropical setting. It doesn't take long for the jailbirds to ditch their prison garb and land some eye candy duds for their swamp journey. You know it's only a matter of time before the obligatory cat fights and wet blouse tussles take center stage. Eventually, redhead Vera (Windsor) with visions of the entire fortune to call her own turns renegade. She ditches the group and attempts to escape with the gems, so why she climbs a tree instead of taking the boat is a mystery.  Mike Connors is credited in the cast as ""Touch"" Connors, and doesn't have much more to do in the film other than ogle the ladies. I'm not sure, but I bet when he auditioned for the part he said he could do it with his hands tied behind his back.  This is another mid 1950's film utilizing a color film process known as Pathe. My copy was heavy on the reds and browns including the swamp scenes, making it all look a bit unnatural. The entire business was filmed in and around New Orleans and Lacombe County. What's surprising is how many name actors wound up in this effort, with one on the way up (Connors), one on the way down (Windsor) and one still going strong (Garland). After watching the movie, there's only one thing that I'm still left wondering about - what prison cell in the country has a window?"
2,"I don't think any of what I wrote qualifies as a ""spoiler"", but I don't want to get blacklisted, so I checked the ""spoiler"" box.   Watchers is my all-time favorite book. When I found out they had done a ""blockbuster"" movie based on the book, I went out and rented it. About 5 minutes into the movie I turned it off. Then I put it back on and watched it. The only plus about any and all of these movies is the dogs they use. They are very well trained animals (I wonder how many dogs they used in total!) and they are gorgeous. The outsider in every one of the movies is lame, nothing like the book (and I know, if they tried to make it like the book says they would have to spend a lot of money and it still wouldn't be up to par to Koontz's imagination) but at least make him like the 3rd movie, more reptilian looking with big claws (that don't dangle!).  Anyways, if I won the lottery I would hire a team to make a mini-series (maybe for the sci-fi channel?) based WORD BY WORD on the book. The way Einstein and Travis meet, all of the k-9 human interactions; the way they meet Nora, the entire book and how it flows compared to any of the movies is just.. sad and pathetic.  So, I wish I won the lottery...."
2,"I can only presume that you came to discover the existence of this truly awful film due to your curiosity of Matt Le Blancs film career or, as I did, it popped up, uninvited, in front of you on cable. I cannot believe that AQM realy got a general cinema release.  AQM is set during World War 2 and is the story of how an American officer, Le Blanc, and a troop of transvestite British soldiers set out to recover an Enigma machine from an all female staffed German factory. That's as much as anyone needs to know about the absurd plot. Everything about this production stinks. Imagine, if you can, coming across the bloody remains of a particularly bloody road kill, the body parts of which are strewn hither and yon. You start to reassemble the beast and what emerges bears no resemblance to anything you've seen before.  The story is predicated upon such a preposterous notion that it is difficult to bring to mind any director adept enough to suspend our disbelief long enough for the humour, what there is of it, to come through;perhaps a Woody Allen of thirty years ago. Le Blanc is hopelessly miscast; slapstick is a forte that few contemporary actors possess and were he so gifted he wouldn't have saved this film anyway. Other featured actors are the noted transvestite comedian Eddie Izzard, who's acting skills and presence haven't improved since the equally awful 'Avengers' and Edward Fox playing guess what? Thats right, a Blimpish army officer.Both actors play their parts absolutely to type. No one was helped by a dire David Schneider screenplay. To British viewers Schneider is more recognisable for his acting stints in Steve Coogans 'Alan Partridge' series and Armando Iannuci's 'Saturday Night Armistice'. Schneider can at least console himself for having not concocting the storyline.  AQM never settles upon knowing what sort of animal it wants to be. It has, about it, shades of Jerry Lewis' 1970 gem 'Which Way to the Front Mein Herr General'. It also has its occasional 'Carry On' moments, yet, still, the bawdy pen of Talbot Rothwell would not have saved this effort. Scenes lurch from the comic set ups to a tearful husband and wife the night before he is to go of into combat. Bathetic in the extreme. Even the grading of the film stock conspires to make this film look cheap. So,if you realy do like to prod road kills with a stick, this film is for you. Otherwise leave well alone, its a stinker."
2,"One of Jack Arnold's lesser efforts, it reverses the ""Invaders From Mars"" theme. Instead of alien's controlling parents, we have kids becoming the mind-controlled tools of forces from beyond who want to stop Earth's ""self-destructive"" ways. Worth a peek for Jackie Coogan and his snug bathing suit."
2,"Another movie featuring Gothic horror that collides with late 1960's psychedelic/Hippie clothing, fashions, design, etc. It makes for a potent combination that is somewhat silly but great fun to look at.  The rumor is that Peter Fonda was supposed to play the lead but Dean Stockwell stepped in at the last minute. It would have sure been a different movie with old Pete. Stockwell gives the role a creepy yet seductive intensity. Could Fonda have done the same? Not so sure about that. I tend to think that Peter Fonda would have been a little too ""slick"" for this role, that is, too much on the side of the sleazy seducer and too little on the side of the menacing necromancer. But, who knows, that's just my silly idle speculation, as Peter never did the role.  This would make a great double feature with ""Simon: King of The Witches,"" also currently available on DVD. Filmed shortly after this film, also has a warlock, and a lot of trippy psychedelic visual effects. Also great fun to look at and quite entertaining performance in the lead role by Andrew Prine."
2,"This is a thoroughly bizarre kung fu action vampire slapstick exploitation movie, essentially an attempt to combine the success of two films, the excellent Chinese hit Mr. Vampire and the international hit The Gods Must Be Crazy (which for reasons unknown to me, was considered ""good"" and ""funny"" upon its release in the US). They also threw in a little Bruce Lee montage at the end, no kidding, but don't worry, they worked it in tastefully-haha! The African bushman from Gods... (yes they got the actual guy) engages in amusing slapstick with a hopping vampire. All the white people are horrible, and the Taoist magician from Mr. Vampire rides an ostrich and saves the day, basically. Somehow this was all worth sitting through, if only for the sake of it being one of the strangest films ever made."
2,"This gem of a TV movie has the Boris Karloff stamp all over it and together with usual atmospheric lighting and production bestowed upon a British TV thriller it makes for compelling viewing. It is nice to see that after a long and successful film career in the US that Mr Karloff decided to return to the land of his birth and make not only this film, but also others like 'Curse Of The Crimson Altar' which were shown on the big screen in the late Sixties and which are now shown regularly in Britain on television.  His performance in 'The Veil' is up to his usual standard. What is particularly interesting is the many characters he plays in this film. He tackles them all - the weird, the wise and the perfectly normal. Robert Hardy too should get a mention for an early performance which showed the promise of what was to come in British television. By the way the year is either 1963 or 1964. I used to know but cannot be sure, now."
2,"Totally good episode in the Sharpe series! Entertaining to the last minute! But like Sharpe's gold this episode doesn't really fit in the main storyline (the war against Napoleon)! Although Sharpe fights against the french (under command of Lupe) it is not really a mission part of Lord Wellingtons big scheme!  *spoiler* The heroic death of Perkins was a surprise and it was good to see Harper and the other chosen men cry! He and Sharpe really cared about their chosen men! I say this because I missed the tears and drama about Sharpe's faked death (they thought he was dead)in Sharpe's Honour! I guess they didn't want do overdo it,it is war and everything! Soldiers should be able to control their emotions!  The action was superb! Although the battle was not a big one it was great to watch Sharpe and his men fighting again like soldiers did in those times! I read some reviews and came across one of comparing this episode to a bad B movie! If you saw this as a stand alone movie than it is not really clear of who Sharpe is and what he does! But I think you have to see this as part of a series,at least you have to seen enough episodes to know the background of the story otherwise much will not make sense!"
1,"This is an excellent example of what can be done on a small budget movie. The acting is excellent considering the script & the whole atmosphere of the film is very foreboding. The gore is well done and used sparingly (look out for the excellent barbed-wire death) & the action is punchy when used. It's true that there are dodgy lines in the script at times, but compared to other movies on the same (or bigger!) budget, it's hardly noticeable at all. Overall, this is recommended. Trust me, it's better than it appears! 8/10"
2,"Dumb and Dumber is a stupid movie, but what some people don't understand is that is what it is supposed to be! It's about two completely pathetic, dumb, and hopeless guys who do nothing but make complete fools of themselves. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels give the greatest comedic performances and form the best duo that has ever graced a screen. Every scene, every sentence they speak, and every body movement is pure genius. The way that each of them deliver their lines makes this movie an all time classic that will never get old. I never understood how someone could not like this movie. The only explanation I could have is they think they are too ""intelligent"" for a ""dumb movie"" like this. What they don't even understand that it's not the jokes or gags that make this movie so great, it is all in the performances. To those of you who do not like this movie please give it another try and watch Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play the roles that they were meant to play."
2,"This game is pretty good, but I liked both Call of Duty 2's better. But this was still a good game. The only thing that I think is bad about it is that there only 13 levels. In Call of Duty, there were 27, and in Call of Duty: Big Red One, there were 14. I would have given this a ten, but I took one star off for that. I also took one star off because at first, the levels seem like they are long, but after you play them for a while, you start to get bored and you realize that the levels aren't that long. I took another star off for that. But the rest of the game is pretty good. It has a really good story that follows the campaign that followed D-Day, and the battles through France between the Americans, British, Scottish, French, Polish, and Canadians against the Germans. It's a pretty good game that, I thought, was kind of a sad ending. Another good thing about it is that instead of fighting and finishing one campaign at a time, you switch off between missions between factions. This was a pretty good game. 8/10."
2,"I've seen every Ma and Pa Kettle film made because I long to be as stoic, calm and unperplexed as was Percy Kilbride, so this film was doubly enjoyable because also I've always been a big Jack Benny fan due to the fact he had the best timing, on radio, TV and movies, of any comedian.  Regarding the storyline,I'm not writing to spoon feed anyone;you can read it for yourselves but I am stating that when it next pops up on Turner,take a peek. Benny plays off Percy; Percy plays off Benny and Ann Sheridan adds a touch of beauty but according to the plot, not brains. And Charles Coburn whom everybody loved (how can anyone dislike Charles Coburn?) lends an air of royalty and connivery to the madcap happenings.  For a pleasant,entertaining and funny romp through cellulod,""GWSH"" is very worthwhile."
0,"""Happy Go Lovely"" has only two things going for it. And those two things are Vera-Ellen's legs. This is a British (Excelsior Films) version of an M-G-M musical complete with second tier stars. I would imagine that Vera-Ellen took this role thinking that it might finally propel her to the status of a major musical star. But, I'm sorry to say, Ms. Ellen's chance did not pay off.  Opening with a horrible Scottish number and stumbling thru awful dialog to the next dull tune, this movie seems very heavy handed and sloppy. The predictable mistaken identity plot is very thin, and with the exception of David Niven, Cesar Romero (who is way over the top in his role of a Producer) and Bobby Howes (who is totally wasted in a nothing role) the rest of the cast is totally forgettable.  The choreography is boring, but Ms. Ellen gives it her all. She was never as famous as most of the other musical stars(and she shouldn't be since she couldn't sing and even had a ""dancing stand in"" in several of her pictures"". But when she did dance, it was just entrancing.  It's too bad that this film that could have made her a star did not give her the tools she needed to shine.  4 out of 10"
2,Saw this film Last monday at NY Film Festival. It has 2 very appealing leads and a solid cast. Its a romantic comedy that tugs at the heart strings and serves up some hot swing music. Its a winning combination that is definitely a chick movie and will also pull in the crowd hungry for nostalgia. What more could you ask for?
1,"Narratives  whether written, visual or poetic epics  generally try to avoid too may characters; readers and viewers, after all, can be too easily overwhelmed by trying to keep track of who exactly is who. This is especially true in film, I think, simply because we cannot easily go back to refresh our memory in a cinema. Viewers like myself, however, don't have that problem because we see all our films on DVD or VHS.  A year ago I was introduced to Audrey Tautou, a French actress, whom I first saw in The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain (2001) and later in A Very Long Engagement (2004), both of which were finely crafted and complex stories with a large cast of characters. This earlier offering exceeds the others in both ways: more characters and more complexity.  Now, other directors have used those techniques before: Robert Altman with The Player (1992), Short Cuts (1993), Gosford Park (2001) and others; Paul Thomas Anderson did the same with Magnolia (1999). Stanley Kramer did it with A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World in 1963, a comedy of almost epic proportions. The difference with this film is, first the director lets us 'see' inside the head of some of the characters and second, some scenes are repeated as means to refresh the viewer's memory as the story flip-flops between different time periods.  The basic  the core, so to speak  story concerns a young woman, Irene (Tautou) who is told, by a fellow commuter on a train, that she will meet her true love on that day. This occurs in the first few minutes of the film. The clever irony at this point is that Irene doesn't realize that the young man opposite (Gilbert Robin) may be that 'one true love'. And, nor does he...  They go their separate ways with neither realizing the potential significance of their close encounter. However, chaos results throughout the rest of the day, not only for the two young people, but for the rest of the characters who appear in a series of cleverly constructed and interwoven vignettes that all seem to be going nowhere, and yet...  If the story were simply that, it could tend to be boring, and even quite predictable. Not so. The script and the director rip into our expectations with a host of innovative scenes that are all too commonplace, but which are turned into believable, extraordinary events that allow the two possible lovers to meet again. For example, the next time some bird poo from the sky drops onto a book or paper of yours, consider your alternatives; two characters make an obvious choice that must occur before Irene and her man of destiny meet again. Or what about a stone chip flying onto your windscreen? Consider again what would happen...  All of that is interesting enough. What was more interesting for me was assessing each new man who came along and trying to decide whether this guy was THE ONE for Irene, or whether it was, in fact, the young man on the train. That kept me guessing for a while.  I'll let you think about that, should you see this delightful romp.  Recommended for all."
2,"An excellent documentary containing tons of archival films of early inventions. People trying to fly with wings strapped to their arms, flying cars, failed parachute experiments, cooking utensils, and much much more. During a visit to Ripley's Odditorium I saw some footage such as is on this film, and I spent nearly a year trying to find it on DVD. This is by far the best, and possibly the only, documentary on such subjects. I was actually in awe of many of the inventions contained in this film, why aren't some of these things available today? Oh,,, how our vision of the future lets us down....  This runs at about 76 minutes long, and it is non-stop entertainment. It also contains many physical experiments as well, such as a woman swinging through New York by gripping a rope with her teeth. Very dangerous acts, human cannonballs and men getting hit in the stomach with sledge-hammers. There is nothing like this film anywhere else, it is truly inspiring, bringing out the creative spirit in all of us."
2,"When someone mentions, ""action movie"", the first thing that gets in their minds is guns, fighting, blood, and so on. The people who they instantly think are the likes of Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Willis, even the hammy Seagal, Snipes and Van Damme! Not until recently, I found myself confused about which action movie is the greatest. For me, the ultimate action hero is Arnold Schwarzenegger, but I cannot seem to find a perfect action movie.  Until I began checking up films of John Woo, and stumbled upon this baby...  Only a handful of action movies can compare to this, but most fail to be better. This movie IS the epitome of an action movie, it has never-ending thrill-a-minute stylish action sequences that just make your jaw drop in amazement. It has a body count that can be compared to most epic movies, and it has an excellent atmosphere to further enhance the story. The action sequences are a combination of outrageous, unreal and cool at the same time.  The story is weak, but not very. It provides the basis for the action to unfold. And boy, when it does, you'll have a blast! I mean, they took the premise of a basic cops and robbers tale and highly jazzed it up somehow to deliver this truly authentic and unique piece of movie making. This is not just a movie which action fans alone should see, this movie deserves to be sought and recognized by other highly-ranked film critics.  The director, John Woo, ups the ante on this one. After glorifying the gangsters in his ""Better Tomorrow"" movies and ""The Killer"" (which almost is as good as Hard Boiled), he decides to glorify the cops, and he does that, but with bigger elements. He doesn't show realism and humanism in this film, because he wanted to emphasize and slightly exaggerate on how big the elements can go. The criminals would kill lots of innocent people to complete their nefarious deeds, and the violence is hyper-stylized to the point where it becomes necessary to subdue the criminals using that technique. He combines unique Chinese Opera dancing techniques and dramatic shootouts to create stylistically significant and exhilarating gunfights for the eyes and ears to behold. The pace is hyper kinetic as Woo relentlessly dishes out whatever tricks he has up his sleeve, much to our delight.  Chow Yun-Fat's status as an action hero is immortalized here in his performance as super cop Tequila, who dodges bullets and shoot crooks while cooing a baby to sleep and covering his eyes from the ensuing violence. This scene also signifies the violence in Hong Kong back in the days, but highly stylized to create a superb action experience. Tony Leung is also splendid as the disillusioned undercover cop, who seeks to regain his humanity and reputation. The rest of the cast gave good performances, with kudos to Anthony Wong as the sadistic villain who will do anything to get what he wants (fully exampled during the film's climax), and Cheng Jue-Luh as one of the most badassed villains ever, Mad Dog.  The atmosphere of the movie further improves its credibility. John Woo's interests are shown through Tequila's passion of jazz and the beautiful and dark cinematography of Hong Kong, which, when combined together, gives an effect that signifies two different worlds, that is, the life of a cop and the life of a criminal. Also, the music score by Michael Gibbs is great, with a perfect melodramatic jazz score during dramatic scenes, and to pumping synthesizers, gritty and haunting scores during the majority of the action sequences. All of these add up to the amazing elements of the movie to make it even better.  Overall, I cannot think of any other action movie than this. This is THE action movie for film-goers, critics, and action junkies alike. This perfectly shot ballet of blood and bullets is an example of how great and reliable Asian movies can be, when we are finally tired of cliché elements from Hollywood. Mr. Woo, Your Midas Touch has its full effect here. This movie is one of the greatest action movies ever made. And I will stand by that decision for as long as I live.  A must see.  9/10  Delton"

0,"Take one look at the cover of this movie, and you know right away that you are not about to watch a landmark film. This is cheese filmmaking in every respect, but it does have its moments. Despite the look of utter trash that the movie gives, the story is actually interesting at some points, although it is undeniably pulled along mainly by the cheerleading squads' shower scenes and sex scenes with numerous personality-free boyfriends. The acting is awful and the director did little more than point and shoot, which is why the extensive amount of nudity was needed to keep the audience's attention.  In The Nutty Professor, a hopelessly geeky professor discovers a potion that can turn him into a cool and stylish womanizer, whereas in The Invisible Maniac, a mentally damaged professor discovers a potion that can make him invisible, allowing him to spy on (and kill, for some reason) his students. Boring fodder. Don't expect any kind of mental stimulation from this, and prepare yourself for shrill and enormously overdone maniacal laughter which gets real annoying real quick..."
2,"Face it-- ""Cinderella"" has been worn out since the day it was conceived. And since, the world has never forgotten this disgustingly sentimental heap of molly-wash. Julie Andrews gives a non-memorable performance in the title role-- where is the interest with which she has played every other part before and since? Other performers have absolutely no redeeming value whatsoever, where Andrews shows promise. But the reality is, the musical score by the normally-excellent Rodgers and Hammerstein is nothing more than a collection of garbage-riddled ditties wallowing in their own pathos. The only acceptable tune in the whole lot is the ""Stepsisters' Lament,"" which occasionally borders on funny. Sadly, the entire telecast is an exercise in sugar-encrusted romantic tripe that makes James Cameron's ""Titanic"" look excellent."
0,"As a big fan of David Mamet's films and plays, especially his first film House of Games that also starred Joe Mantegna, I was expecting great things from this film. Instead, I found myself annoyed by the film's superficiality and lack of credibility. Racial slurs are thrown about without any feeling or meaning behind them, in the hopes of setting up a racial tension that for me never materialized. Identity is totally reevaluated and men become ""heroes"" for no apparent reason. Because of his oaths taken as a cop, the lead character adamantly refuses to perform one relatively small action that would harm no one and could possibly save lives, and yet performs another action which is very violent and VERY illegal, but then still refuses the minor action. In addition, a highly unbelievable subplot involving a man who has killed his family is introduced just for the sake of a plot point that was all but advertised with skywriting, and the cop's reaction to that occurrence stretch credulity way beyond all reasonable limits. Needless to say, after expecting another exciting thriller from David Mamet, I was extremely disappointed to say the least. 3 out of 10."
2,"I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago. Actually, you can't call it a movie because it's much more than that, it is a kind of mini-series. ""La Meglio Gioventu"" tells the story of two brothers: Matteo and Niccola. It starts when they are both about 18 years old; two young idealist who want to discover and change the world. What follows is partly Italian history, but mainly the personal history of the two brothers, growing up and finding their way through life.  This is one of the most beautiful, touching and human stories of the latest years. I enjoyed seeing this very much. Six hours may seem a long time but it isn't to tell a story of 50 years. It is wonderful to see both brothers growing up and changing.  The acting is excellent and the story is touching; the director has eye for detail and he manages the capture life in a very unique way. I can only advise everyone to see this. Outstanding! 9/10"
2,"Dinner With Friends is the perfect movie for those who felt that Notting Hill was a little too action-packed. The story involves two post-yuppie couples, one of whom split up, and how it affects all of their lives. The film mainly consists of the four of them discussing relationships with each other - and I'm talking about ninety percent conversation here, so be warned - while occasionally interrupted with people looking emotional.  This would be a great film for those interested in the psychology behind modern relationships. For the rest of us, it's a potential cure for insomnia."
2,I saw this on DVD for £2 and i thought i would check it out and see if it is any good and............it's crap. Seriously this is not worth £2. It is a load of crap. They make so many mistakes. At the beginning this bike does a flip and on 1 shot he faces the wrong way but in the second shot the bike amazingly turns the right way. The acting is rubbish. Dennis Rodman can't act to save his life and neither can the others but i must admit that i found Dane Cook funny at times. The action is poor and ruined by special effects and the gadgets are just stupid. What ever you do don't watch this film. It is rubbish from start to finish.
2,"""Son of Dracula"" is an incredibly entertaining entry in the series.  **SPOILERS**  Arriving at the Caldwell Estate in Memphis, Tennessee, Frank Stanley, (Robert Paige) and Dr. Harry Brewster, (Frank Craven) bring back a set of coffins for Katherine Caldwell, (Louise Allbritton) but her guest does not arrive. Soon after, a series of misfortunes befall the family, and Dr. Brewster decides to call in Professor Lazio, (J. Edward Bromberg) an expert on superstitious matters. He believes that her guest, Count Alucard, (Lon Chaney Jr.) Isn't who he appears to be. As they begin trying to discover his true identity, a rash of murders around the countryside point them to the only true person he can really be.  The Good News: This is a far better film than what it's reputation has given it. The film's best attribute is it's undeniable mood and atmosphere. The tangled vines and muddied waters of the bayou are as sinister as any desolate mountain road in Transylvania. The consistent overgrowth and dank air give a sense of discomfort, especially in the bog scenes. The house itself is a large Gothic monstrosity, and has a sinister appeal to it that works incredibly well. There are several scenes that are quite moody and add immensely to the mood. The sequence where Dracula's coffin rises from beneath the muck of the swamp and then glides toward the waiting Katherine, floating over the waters is a clear-cut highlight, looking equally impressive in both execution, creativeness and look. The initial transformation sequence where, from behind, Dracula evaporates into a bat and flies off in seamless motion is a close second, and is a really impressive scene as well. It's one of the fastest moving films as well, making it seem like there's no real stop and that's always a plus. This was a far better film that what it really could've been.  The Bad News: There's several things wrong with this one that could've been fixed. The plot in general is a confusing mess. In fact, it's never adequately explained whether Alucard is the son of Dracula or actually Dracula himself. There's a vague mention of it but nothing is really concretely explained at all. It's pretty hard to believe the nonsense story given as a cover story for the Count as well, as it's a really obvious trick and is discovered far too easily for it to have any real effect on the use of it. It's also quite easy to find several gaping logic and plot holes in here that differ from the norm of vampires, yet these spoil the plot and can't be revealed. This really were all I could find wrong with this one.  The Final Verdict: A very solid and entertaining entry that is far better than it's status and keeps it far from boring. There's several small flaws here and there, but these can be overlooked as the good points far outweigh the bad ones. Recommended to the fans of the first parts in the series and those who love the Universal films.  Today's Rating-PG: Violence"
2,"i agree with a lot of the previous reviews for this film although there are a number of points that i find myself forced to disagree with. but first off this is a fantastic visual film with primary colours leaping off the screen with a few nice touches of black and white in the background to add contrast.  the acting is, well it depends on how you look at acting. all of the actors played their parts well although they were all cartoon cutout characters. special mention must be made of the oh so evil hitman with his pencil thin mustache (which had a distressing tendency to not always be in quite the same place) and the leading lady who was rarely stretched from the demands of looking lovely whilst looking into the middle distance with a slight frown on her face. she does however, deserve some credit for always being able to find her co-actors as in seemingly every close up she tended to disappear in a fog the likes of which has rarely been seen outside of an episode of the original 'Star Trek' (you can almost hear the director imploring his cinematographer to 'add more vaseline to the lens!').  but where the film fails for me is that it wishes to both have its cake and eat it. it is very happy and indeed very good at playing fast and loose with many different styles of cinema (sergio leone western with rocket launchers?!??! or a plot that is strictly 50's US b-movie fodder with sam peckinpah gouts of blood and copious slow-mo's) but it wishes to be both funny and touching and sad at the same time. this was a film that was crying out for an ending that was in keeping with the rest of the film but instead we got a (very) bad copy of 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon'. now CTHD has been mentioned in an earlier review here and while i can (just) see that you can link the two, if nothing else it has opened up more main-stream audiences to subtitles, to compare them is really very, very pointless. this is a good joking film that never takes itself seriously except at the worst time, the end. CTHD was simply excellent.  but if you want some pure entertainment then this film really does deliver. if you are a movie snob like me, then sure you can look down on it. but there would be little point in that as you would only be missing the point of the sheer silliness and entertainment that this film delivers (i really did love the bit with the teeth though!)"
0,"Well done Al Gore! You have become the first person to have made 1 Billion dollars of the global warming lie! Just like all the other man made fable's in the world this one is up there with the best lies to have sucked in so many people. Sure polution is not a good thing, and I would love for all the tree's to keep on growing, but global warming is a business! It employes thousands of people that are all very mislead.  Google it! There are just to many things that just don't add up, but well done Al, you failed as a politician, but went on to make lots of money sucking in the world.  Whats next? Santa is real?"
1,"Tight script, good direction, excellent performances, strong cast, effective use of locations....  Paul McGann gives a detailed, subtle performance as the man in the centre of a new murder investigation who may just have committed a similar murder previously.  There is an interesting moral & emotional journey happening with his character (Ben Turner) and it intersects with the journey undertaken by Amanda Burton. Inevitably they cross over... Who has done what?  The examination of WHY, both in the past and in the present, rather than WHO might have yielded a more interesting, Dostoyevskian story, but hey, who's complaining?  "
2,"Sohpie's Choice has got to be the most heartbreaking movie I have seen in a long time. It is a tragic love story between Sophie (Meryl Streep) and Nathan (Kevin Klein) who meet an unsuccessful writer named Stingo. They become great friends and Stingo soon discovers the darkness of Nathan, and Sophie's most heart-wrenching secrets.   I'm quite surprised this movie hasn't made it to IMDb's top 250 list, because this should be a movie that is recognized as the best performance from Meryl Streep in film history. Fantastic movie, truly heartbreaking, but very well made.  10/10"
1,"""A Girl's Folly"" is a sort of half-comedy, half-mockumentary look at the motion picture business of the mid-1910's. We get a glimpse of life at an early movie studio, where we experience assembly of a set, running through a scene, handling of adoring movie fanatics, even lunch at the commissary. We are also privy to little known cinematic facts - for example, did you know that ""Frequently, 'movie' actors do not know the plot of the picture in which they are working""?  The plot of this film in essence is movie star Kenneth Driscoll's discovery and romancing of a budding young starlet whom he discovers while shooting on location in the country. I believe the 30-minute version I watched was abridged, included on the same tape with Cecil B. De Mille's ""The Cheat."" It is a very credible film - an easy watch with a large cast of extras. As a bonus it includes some of best-illustrated captions I have ever seen accompanying a silent movie."
2,"After seeing some good reviews on IMDb For this pointless waste of time i decided to watch it with a group of mates.   BIG MISTAKE!   I want my sat night back, but more, i want the trust i also lost with my friends back, as i will probably never be allowed to choose a movie again.  Don't get me wrong, this movie looked pretty good at the start. Building up characters for the audience to slightly get connected to, Only to lead to absolutely nothing. I was expecting to see another LA riot. But what you get is about as exciting as the dramas in the Brady Bunch movie. This movie dragged on building up its climax only fizzel out just when things looked good.   This would barely make it as a mid-day movie. It gets a 3 because the acting was pretty good.   But having a black-out in your own home would be just as exciting."
2,"There are two ways you can look at this film. The first is simply as a drama film like any other, a well-set piece for the epoch it unfolds in; certainly the clothing and set accessories are all in their right place for the 70's/80's. The acting is quite impressive all around: Jesse Eisenberg and Jason Ritter are the stars of the show, commanding very well-built characters; one a more introspective, unspoken kid and the other a more domineering, swagger-carrying bad-ass. Chris Marquette and Sebastian Stan are also worthy of note, as is Eva Amurri as the typical thrill-seeking bored rich girl - the type that tends to want what she can't have, in this case a guy who is perhaps not to be trifled with, possibly of the kind she is ill-equipped to deal with, or at least to deal with as she does - again the typical heart-breaking machinery at work.  The other way you can look at this film is as a Fred Durst production. Considering he was the director, you're ready to give it more credit than it would be worth straight out of the bat. It is quite impressive on his part that he was able to put this together (if such was the case), even if marks of a certain lack of experience are visible throughout. First we have the screenplay - some of what the characters are saying is repetitive and at times nonsensical. The dialogue could have been more elaborate - that would certainly have upped the quality and believability quotient - not that the film strays too far from reality - in fact it tends to steer back on track and find it's way safely to the end, yet scenes such as the one when Jason Ritter is in the bar by himself with only a few ""workers"" around him and the things the barman spouts there. These exhibitions of class demarcation and the like are ultimately unreal. There is also an ongoing attack at ""rich people"" in general, when the case being considered is that of the spoiled offspring of some rich people - not all ""rich people"" are worthy of scorn. Second there is the unnecessary use of swear words. At a certain point in the film these just become tiring. Not that films should forcefully not contain these, the simple fact is a film reads differently than, say, a rap album with explicit content.  However you look at it, notwithstanding, the film still pulls through successfully. Considering the kind of garbage being thrown our way these days, The Education Of Charlie Banks stands. The title is fitting; indeed, even if we may think otherwise, Charlie is the one who ends up learning from things. He in a way corrects his ways and makes the right choice. He shows humanity, he tries to be cooperative as opposed to being oppressive. Here the film triumphs, in that it reveals a positive message.  Kudos to otherwise career-dead Durst for carrying this one through; let's hope he learns from his mistakes and rises to make better things? One can't help but think this could have been so immensely better with a different director, yet it is still surprising that it was carried under his wing.  6.5(7)/10"
2,"After a series of silly, fun-loving movies, 1955 was a big year for Doris Day. That year saw her handed the role of singer Ruth Etting, who made it to the top but whose personal life suffered for her success.  The film begins with a chance meeting by Etting at a dime-a-dance joint with gangster Martin Snyder, brilliantly played by James Cagney. Cagney, with his connections, brings stardom to Etting, but she loses her freedom to a miserable existence dominated by Snyder, who ultimately marries her, after a memorable fight on opening night at the Ziegfeld Follies.  Day's singing was never better. In addition to the old Etting favorites, she sings the new song I'll Never Stop Loving You.  Cowboy movie actor, Cameron Mitchell, turns in an equally strong performance as piano player, Johnny Alderman, who leaves Etting, out of disgust for the way she is being dominated, only to encounter her years later, when the two of them are working on a movie. Their revived romance leads to near tragedy.  Cagney received a well-deserved Oscar Nomination. To this day, I'll never understand why Day and the film were overlooked for Oscar nominations."
2,"""The Bat"" is indeed a very silly low budget mystery film. There are very few male characters, therefore it is not difficult to guess who ""The Bat"" is. Vincent Price, in the role of Dr. Malcolm Wells, has a good performance and a well developed character. The banker John Fleming has a minor but also very important participation in the plot. However, the motives of the behavior and double-identity of Lt. Andy Anderson are not explained; Cornelia van Gorder, played by Agnes Moorehead, unsuccessfully tries to be an Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot, resolving the murders, but her character is simply awful. The cold reaction of the women in the mansion when their close friend Judy Hollander dies due to the insistence of Dale Bailey to leave their locked room is a shame. My vote is four.  Title (Brazil): ""A Mansão do Morcego"" (""The Mansion of the Bat"")"
2,"Awful is a good word to start with. are you others stuck in the 80's or just pretentious film students? i have seen better ""stuff"" in my toilet. i am a James spader fan, but after seeing this movie early one morning suffering from insomnia i question his ability as a person. for Christ's sake he is a fellow mick and Bostonian and could not pull off the accent! not only that the movie sucked more than a hooker on a good day! all you lovers of starcrossed, it is time to put away the d&d game and move out of mom's house and get a job. if i ever see this movie on my t.v. again i will vomit and then drop my t.v. off a thirteen story building! James spader should be ashamed, better yet humiliated for ever even thinking this movie was a good career move! and you lovers of it GET A LIFE!"
2,"This movie fits poorly with the first and tries too hard to link itself with it.  The acting is medium to bad. Little feeling and hardly engaging.  The plot is lame as I could predict every person who was killed and in what way at every interval. Besides completely destroying the mood of the first film, this one adds sex and profanity. Both are highly out of place and are obviously stuck in to get more viewers.  Gore and sex do not a movie make.  I don't have any idea why a Native American character was forced into the plot. It was odd and seemed like a purposeful ethnic diversification of the movie. Lame.  One plot note: Satan kills the two guys in the news van early on, infuses 'Mikey', and promptly disappears from the plot.  The first one is better, much better. Overall, very poor. 1/10"
0,"This grainy film has a cult following and one of those word-of-mouth features you just had to see. Maybe hard to believe, but there is a rural community in southwest Arkansas, Fouke, that knows the legend is true. This tale is told in documentary-style narrated by Vern Stierman and filmed in actual locations talking to actual folks involved. The legend changes with the telling, but during the late 60s and most of the 70s the surrounding area of Fouke was visited by a Bigfoot-like creature that traveled along Boggy Creek. Long limbed with three toes and standing over 7 foot tall, this hirsute creature periodically caused damage and frightened the 'bejeebers' out of most of the community. I personally crossed over the small Boggy Creek bridge in 1974, and yes the hair on the back of my neck did rise. Of course it was about 1 a.m. in the rain. By the time I arrived in Shreveport, I was laughing."
1,"Man On Fire tells a story of an ex-special forces guy with a drinking problem who accepts a job as a personal bodyguard of a little girl in Mexico during the wave of kidnappings for ransom. At first he's not to friendly, but then they befriend with each other, he decides to stop drinking etc., etc... then one day she gets kidnapped... and killed...  And HE, won't stop at anything to get the revenge.  That's basically the story of Man On Fire but expect some big twists at least a few times including the ending which is beautiful and will probably make you cry.  That's also because of the great music Harry-Gregson Williams with Lisa Gerrard (Gladiator) composed.  But the strongest part of the movie... wait... the thing is, everything here is perfect.  First - acting. Denzel Washington is at his best, Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken good as always, great Radtha Mitchell and AMAZING young Dakota Fanning. And that's not the end of the list...  Then come the cinematography which is dazzling and along with superb editing, should have won an Oscar for sure.  The story is... not just a revenge movie. The story is intelligent, the story makes you think... and is pure beautiful. Really.  This is one of those movies you need to see in your lifetime, at least once!"
2,"After playing such suave and sophisticated folks as James Bond and Simon Templar, Roger Moore went in for a real change of pace in North Sea Hijack. I'm guessing that's what attracted him to the role of Rufus Excalibur Ffolkes, because though North Sea Hijack is a nice action, adventure film, it's nothing out of the ordinary.  Mr. Ffolkes is a fellow who despises women is only wanting companionship of those of the feline persuasion and is a singularly short tempered and quite arrogant individual. He also knows his business thoroughly as the head of a mercenary team for hire.  Her Majesty's government has hired him to do a nasty job on some people who have hijacked an offshore oil rig in the North Sea and are threatening to blow it up. The environmental and economic consequences would be catastrophic to say the least. Here in America we well remember the Exxon Valdez and the results of that oil spill off the Alaska shores.  The hijackers led by Anthony Perkins are not political terrorists in any way. They're just a gang of extortionists who think they've found a way to make money. Still the results of their actions would be the same.  Perkins gives a nice performance in an unusual role for him. He was forever identified throughout his life with psychotic killer Norman Bates, and his role as chief hijacker is anything, but the mama dominated schizophrenic Bates. One of the interesting things here is we never do learn just what the escape plan for the hijackers is. It's just possible that Perkins really does just want things to go boom.  North Sea Hijack is a nicely paced action film that has a lot of suspense to it. Also check it out for nice performances by James Mason as an admiral in the Royal Navy and Faith Brook as a British Prime Minister who looks and acts suspiciously like Margaret Thatcher."
0,"What happened? What we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast, but somewhere the movie loses it. Actually, it never really got going. There was a little excitement when we find out that Angie is not really pregnant, then find out that she is after all, but that was it. Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie, was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie, other than to make it longer. I really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and maybe try not for a pure comedy, which unfortunately it was not, but maybe a drama with comedic elements. I think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here I can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot."
2,"I hated this film. The whole movie is brooms getting water. This film made me sleep. I can't believe that it is in IMDb's Top 250 list. This is the worst film I have ever seen. This should be #1 on the bottom 100 on IMDb. If you liked this movie, you need new taste. If you hated this film, you got good taste."
2,"From the director of the better known ""Alla Ricerca del Piacere"" (aka ""Amuck!"") comes this stylish thriller that involves not only a confusing web of love affairs and relationships, but also - towards the climax - a bundle of twists that are guaranteed to surprise every viewer without becoming implausible at any moment.  And this is the big plus of this movie: The twists all work. The first half moves on relatively slow (similar to Silvio Amadio's above mentioned earlier Giallo), but the viewer already gets enough information to know that the plot isn't as simple as it seems. In the second half the film becomes a roller coaster ride of red herrings, plot twists and other surprises, which makes it decisively superior to Amadio's earlier effort.  The acting is also thoroughly convincing, which is especially important once the film is finished and the viewer gets the whole story. But the most remarkable thing in this intriguing Giallo is the lush, ear-catching main theme that will never let one go after being heard for the first time."
0,  What an absolutely crappy film this is. How or why this movie was made and what the hell Billy Bob Thornton and Charlize Theron were doing signing up for this mediocre waste of time is beyond me. Strong advise for anyone sitting down to catch a flick: DO NOT waste your time on this 'film'.
1,"when i first heard about this movie i thought it would be like The Duchess(2008), but when i saw the first 30 minutes of The Young Victoria i knew this wouldn't just be a solid movie. Almost everything in this movie is great, the costumes are really amazing and the settings are also beautifully shot.  The only thing that really let me down are the performances. Emily Blunt(The Devil Wears Prada) is the star of the film, bringing Victoria to life and with this movie she shows that she is a great actress and maybe picking a first Oscar nomination for her performance. Rupert Friend is almost bland as Prince Albert but he has great chemistry with Emily Blunt. Paul Bettany is also solid as Lord Melbourne although i expected more of him. Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson both have supporting roles but are forgettable.  To me the film feels like unfinished. Maybe that the screenwriters changed too many things in the script, i don't know but that's how i feel about the movie.  But overall it's a great movie about the early years of Victoria with a Great performance from Emily Blunt."
2,"Beauty and the Beast is without a doubt one of Disney's finest classics. The first animated film to ever be nominated for best picture and after you see it, you could understand and agree with it's nomination. Beauty and the Beast is going to be one of those films that will always be remembered, I know that it's a movie that I will show my children one day. It has unbelievably terrific animation, a beautiful story, lovable characters, and is just over all a perfect movie. I really love this film so much, I don't think anyone couldn't fall in love with it.  Bell is just a simple girl in her town in France, she reads books constantly and her father is an inventor. They are sort of the outcasts of their town due to their ""oddness"". But Bell is being pursued by the town hunk, Gueston, simply because she's the one girl he cannot have. One day when her father's inventions are about to be displayed at the fair, he gets lost in the woods and stumbles across a castle and is held prisoner. Bell goes after him and comes to the castle; it turns out that her father is being held by a beast who is cursed with this hideousness unless he finds a true love before a rose he has welts. Bell trades places with her father; the house also has living objects, a candle holder, a clock, a tea pot, all who are also cursed until the curse is broken. They look at Bell as the perfect opportunity for the beast to find a true love, but he must learn to be a gentleman, but Bell brings out the best in him and it turns out that this might be a happy ending after all.  This was actually the first movie that I ever cried in, the ending was just so beautiful and heart felt, you'll have to see what I mean. The songs are just so lovely and perfect for the scenes that they are performed for. Beauty and the Beast, the song, was just one of the most touching songs ever. This films is a major recommendation for me, it's one of my favorite Disney films of all time, it's a timeless classic that is just perfect and reached a new level of great animation.  10/10"
1,"Having read many of the other reviews for this film on the IMDb there is ostensibly a consensus amongst purists that this film is nothing like the books upon which it is based. Upon this point I cannot comment, having never actually read any of the protagonists adventures previously. However, what I can say with certainty, is that it strikes me that many of the said reviewers must have surely undergone a sense of humour bypass; Let's be honest here - this film is just so much fun!  OK..so I must concede the point that the film apparently is not representative of the character/s but let's put this into a clear perspective..do the same individuals who are carping on about this film also bemoan the fact that the classic 1960's Batman series does not remain faithful to the original DC comic book character? Or perhaps is there STILL unrest in same persons that the 1980 film version of Flash Gordon was too much of a departure from the original series?  The point is, yes this film is incredibly camp but that's precisely its charm!  Former Tarzan, Ron Ely plays the eponymous hero in this (and bears more than a passing resemblance to Gary Busey to boot!) and is backed up by a great supporting cast who all look to be having a ball with their respective roles. Also look out for a very brief but highly welcome appearance by horror movie favourite Michael Berryman.  Best scene? Far too many to choose from but check out the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the waiter when Savage and his men commit the ultimate faux pas of ordering coke, lemonade and milk at a formal occasion! Also the often noted scene near the end of the film wherein Savage tackles his nemesis Captain Seas utilising various martial arts disciplines which are labelled on screen!  Priceless!  Simply put, the film doesn't take itself at all seriously and is all the more fun for it. Great fun from start to finish! (and you'll be singing the John Phillip Sousa adapted theme song for days afterwards guaranteed!)"
0,"With one of my very favorite actors, James Spader, I expected this film to be at least tolerable. It wasn't. After the first half hour I watched the rest of it with the remote control in my hand so the fast forward was at the ready. So trite, so standard, one knows what's going to happen in each scene. One can even predict the dialogue word for word. This is one of those movies that makes one scratch ones head and say, ""How did this movie ever get made?"" In an effort to say something positive, I'll add that there are some mildly entertaining special effects. But, on the whole, if you've seen 5 Sci/fi movies, or you are over 9 years old, do yourself a favor and skip this one."
1,"This is a great movie that I don't think gets enough credit as Saturday Night Fever or Grease in John Travolta's career. He plays a man who is in love with a girl but is too pig headed to admit his feelings to her. Instead, he wants to engage in mechanical bull riding because he thinks it will show his manhood. Even though it was made in 1980, it is still timely today. The great country music soundtrack is terrific. 10/10"
2,"Forget the awful series. Forget the even worse Hollywood remake 'The Assassin'. Remember Luc Besson's La Femme Nikita.  This has got to be one of the most stylish, moody and gripping films in existence. Luc Besson's direction is refreshing whilst the cinematography is simply stunning, particuarly the scene in the hotel where Nikita gets her first assignment. The soundtrack by Eric Serra is simply genius and actually adds something to the film...soundtracks usually seem to be an afterthought but refreshingly; not in this case.  The beautiful Anne Parillaud is perfect in the lead role (unlike Bridget Fonda) and the subtle romance between her and Tcheky Karyo is pure eloquence. The hugely talented Jean-Hughes Anglade (of Betty Blue fame) shines in this film but of all the male roles, Jean Reno (also fabulous in Luc Besson's Leon)is outstanding as the completely unbalanced Victor The Cleaner. Jeanne Moreau as Amande makes a notable appearence following years of contributions in countless films.  Luc Besson established himself as one of the leading innovative directors with this film and you can easily see why. This movie certainly rates among the top 10 films of all time.  I could pontificate about this film all day and all night but the best thing is for you to watch it yourself as a matter of priority...it is a 'must see'.  I'm off now to pursue a career in international assassinations."
2,"Stand out to me in this episode was always Phyllis Douglas as Yeoman Mears.  Why was she on the shuttle? A quick check to see what else she had done, surprise, surprise, she is in Gone With the Wind as baby Bonnie Blue Butler.  Scarlett and Rhett's prized baby girl. It is to laugh.  Near 30 years on, she is tangling with a Vulcan.  This episode should also be noted as not following thru with the incorrect notion that all the guys in the red shirts are killed (both victims of the planet's monsters wore yellow shirts) and likewise the equally inexplicable idea that all the black guys were killed (the minority in this case survived).  In truth, this episode watches like a strange predecessor to the disaster movie; who will survive, who will die? The three cast members will survive, the woman should survive so there won't be any calls of unfairness to women and Don Marshall should survive, which he did.  Not a bad episode, actually.  Wish there had been more episodes with Phyllis Douglas in them tho."
2,"Did anyone else get the vibe, at the start of the movie, that the vampires were a commentary on the Jewish people? Or am I looking too much into a B- movie...? The first glimpse we get of the vampire community is a WW2 style vampire safe house, complete with said period's costumes, and the NSA's costumes are very Nazi-like. And there's the whole 'we fear them because they're a different 'ethnicity'' thing. This may have been a theme started in the movie, but of course, was forgotten as the film underwent several style-changes (by which I mean, it went off on a tangent to rip off some other movies) But yeah, as mentioned above, there were lots of scenes that paid homage to (see...ripped off) Brazil, Blade, The Matrix, Tarantino,..even Highlander. A mucky piece of work, with too many genre stereotypes, and what was with Woodbine's gruff, 'bad boy' voice?"
0,"Having seen three other versions of the same film, I am afraid for me this is by far the weakest, primarily due to Scott's rather dull and leaden performance. His emotions throughout are so bland it makes it difficult to engage in the film. Alistair Sim portrayed the role infinitely better. When Scrooge was at his meanest, you don't get the sense Scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly unconvincing. I cannot think of any actors in this film who match those from the Alistair Sim version. Even the musical version (and frankly the Muppets) take on this are better executed. Very disappointing."
0,"I have heard about this novel a long time ago, many of my friends have recommend me to read it. I searched it in every place and finally found it. This is a book that every man should read, because it is genius and because of it's vision. I enjoyed every page.  I knew about the movie and could not wait to see it. When I finally did I was very disappointed, many things that are in the book are not in the movie (I do not think that this is a spoiler) that just makes the movie not logical... Michael Radford might be a good director, but a bad writer. Especially as a book adopter. The movie is not dark at all, the writing is really bad, the only thing that is good, even great, is the acting. John Hurt is an amazing actor and the only face I myself could see as Winston Smith.  What angers me the most are the people in IMDb that called this ""The Best Adaptation Ever"" without even reading the book! Or knowing anything about screen writing!  You can only understand the brilliance of the story by reading the book, do not consider this as an alternative. As a fan of the book, I was very disappointed.  The points I gave for this movie goes for the acting."
1,"This show has all the typical characters in a comedy: the good guy, the idiot, the pervert, the rich girl... but it's set on the 70's. That's the only difference that it has with other TV comedies. I don't know how you can like this show. Its humor is pathetic! I mean, the jokes are so direct... A typical dialog is this: ""Fez: Oh, Jackie I want to have sex with you. (audience laughs) Jackie: Fez you're a pervert. (audience laughs) Fez: Oh yes I am. (audience cheers and applauds)"" This isn't funny. I think that if it didn't have those laughs (I don't know how you call that in English, sorry) you wouldn't laugh at all. This isn't intelligent comedy, this is an insult to the public. I like most of the American comedies, but this isn't good at all. I would give it 4 out of 10. (Sorry for my poor English again.)"
1,I was never a big fan of television until I watched 24 for the first time. I got into the series very late. Season 5 ended before I even saw my very first episode. It was an episode of Series 3 that was on my parents DVR (digital video recorder) box while I was house sitting for the weekend. It took that one episode for me to be hook line and sinker into the world of Jack Bauer. And boy was I hooked!! I watched the next six episodes without blinking an eye. The next day I went to Blockbuster and signed up for an unlimited month pass for twenty something dollars and needless to say it has been the greatest blockbuster money I've ever spent. I watched the first three seasons in three weeks. That's 72 forty minute episodes!!! I will say that finding out what happens next is easier on DVD than waiting an entire week. I can only imagine the anticipation of watching Season 6 week to week!! I find it mildly torturous and cruel but I'm going to give it a try and watch it just like the rest of America!! The DVR is set and you can bet I'll be chomping at the bit!!
0,"This movie is not as good as all the movies of Christ I've ever seen. And I'm quite amazed that in this story Pilate wants to finish Jesus, when the Scriptures (as well the other movies) state differently. It lacks also a very important issue: The Resurrection.. None of the other movies skip this very important part: the faith of all of us Christians lies in this very event. As Paul says in one of his letters ""If Christ did not rise from the dead, our faith is vain"". A very impressive scene for me in this movie was seeing on the streets the remains of the palms that were used when Jesus entered Jerusalem.   Finally, and in opposition to my Jewish co-commentator, Jesus WAS NOT a myth. And as a matter of fact, he was also a JEW. There are plenty of documents (relgious and secular) that prove the existence of this extraordinary man(or should I said, God become a man) that indeed changed mankind. I strongly advise him(given he is a historian) to read about Flavius Josephus, the most brilliant Jewish commentator of the 1st. Century."
2,"I cannot comprehend how films this bad get made, what with all the time, money and effort that goes into film-making. Didn't anyone (the director, the producer, the editors) WATCH the film??? Couldn't they SEE how bad it was??? It contains some of the WORST acting I have ever seen. Reminded me of one of those ""adult"" films that Showtime broadcasts late at night. Just simply awful. I still can't believe that Nastassja Kinski agreed to be a part of this. Fortunately for us, David Bailey hasn't directed another feature-length film since! Avoid this piece of crap at ALL COSTS. Better yet, BUY every copy you can find, both the VHS and the DVD (I guarantee you this will be in the El Cheapo Clearance Dump Bins all over the world), and destroy them to spare the rest of humanity from this atrocity..."
0,"The story is about the life of common people from Antwerp, living their lives. So I said it, and there is nothing more actually to tell about the story. The movie is fast, like an MTV-flick, and well photographed and we feel that the director is talented and should do more films. So let's forget about this one and hope for the best with the next Deus-Barman picture."
2,"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a film unlike any I've ever seen and probably ever will. A true epic that left me utterly speechless. It accomplished so much through such simplicity. Everything was top notch from the elegant directing to the subtly wonderful performances down to the magical score. The film demands you to feel not only for the death we witness, but for the incredible life we discover. It prays on the obvious morality issues we all deal with but also dangles the idea in front of us that everyone goes through the same joys and grievances, just not in the same way. This is a momentous tale that deserves nothing less than the title of brilliance.   This visually and emotionally rich movie recalls the life of a very peculiar man born in the early 20th century who ages backwards. His tale unfolds through a diary read by the daughter of his love, Daisy. Throughout life he goes through the same things we do, growing up and eventually growing old. He's a thoughtful observer, discovering life from all different angles. But it is not his life that makes him unique. His love is what makes him special. He spends a lifetime trying to understand how his love for Daisy works and still only gets a few incredible years really loving her. As their lives tell us, the years of frustration and hardship are all worth it if only for a few moments of happiness.   The direction in the film is almost flawless. Hopefully, Benjamin Button will garner David Fincher the recognition he deserves. He winds this clock so well and with such grace that the movie has this undeniable flow that is enjoyable from start to finish. At nearly 3 hours, there is not a minute wasted. Every shot is jaw dropping and while some will find issue with the time, it is used wisely.   The acting is also a thing of wonder. This is by far Brad Pitt's best performance. He is so believable and realistic throughout. His nuances are spot on and despite the heavy use of make-up and CGI used to portray his character, it is Pitt who makes Benjamin that much more curious.   I left the theater astonished that some one could review this movie badly. It is an extremely graceful depiction of life, love, and the things we lose. After so much anticipation I was certainly not disappointed. This movie is probably not for everyone though. It's not your average drama that spoon feeds it's audience their emotions. It is something of awe and astonishment, an absolute gem. What makes our lives memorable are the moments we never seem to grasp long enough before letting go. Life in itself is indeed very, very curious and Benjamin Button is no less of a wonder."
0,"A low budget effort from Texas that's at least filmed well, but that is little consolation. Bad acting, or, should I say, bad over-acting, a pretty limp story line that's nothing new, bad special effects, bad, bad, bad. Seems like a bunch of young folks are putting together a haunted house for Halloween, which is done every year, but this year things are different. Has a long extended lesbian theme that is not only annoying but definitely fills out the empty spots, of which there are a lot. Putrid, puerile, definitely avoidable, at all costs."
2,"This movie on the back says that it is in vein of Dawn of the dead and Shaun of the Dead. Somebody lied!! This movie is completely opposite. The only good thing about this movie is that the girls in it looked good. The rest had really nothing to do with zombies. Do Not rent even if your bored. Stay Bored, go play with yourself or something, anything would be better than this crap. Now I will say this; the weird guy with the camera, i think his name was lucky, got to see the girl topless and then recorded it on the camera. Whats funny though is the fact that 5 seconds later we see him sitting on a rock by himself playing a challenging game of pocket pool, but before he can finish flogging the dolphin he gets scared and runs away. Even though this is sick it just shows that if this was the best part of the movie imagine what the rest of the movie is like."
2,"Very beautiful and original pictures in this movie. You can also enjoy such simple things as the sound of the snow falling or a scissors cutting a wool cloth...  In my opinion, the movie is not repetitious. I think the intention of the director is to introduce you in the monks' everyday life, and therefore you have to understand the routine and discipline they are attached to. It is just the silence that illuminates these people.  And I didn't know there were such really sweet monks in the catholic church!   At the cinema everybody were staying till the very end, although I have to say that someone was sleeping behind me ;-)"
0,"It's 1982, Two years after the Iranian Embassy Siege which involved the dramatic SAS Rescue from the Balconys, and with a War with Argentina over the Falkland Islands currently taking place, what better film to make than a Gung-Ho ""SAS"" Film that re-creates the Iranian Hostage siege, whilst using Britains Number one action hero of the day, Lewis Collins. throw in Edward Woodward and a few other Well known actors and you've got a winner on your hands?...Well maybe not! The film itself doesn't make the situation serious enough, whilst the acting is quite second rate. it's like a Movie long episode of ""The Professionals"", but without the formula. This film goes nowhere fast and is quite predictable. Maybe Cubby Brocoli watched this film and decided to ditch Lewis Collins as a Touted James Bond Replacement for Roger Moore. Watch it if your a fan of Lewis Collins or SAS stuff in General, if not, save your time."
0,"Apparently, The Mutilation Man is about a guy who wanders the land performing shows of self-mutilation as a way of coping with his abusive childhood. I use the word 'apparently' because without listening to a director Andy Copp's commentary (which I didn't have available to me) or reading up on the film prior to watching, viewers won't have a clue what it is about.  Gorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be lured into watching The Mutilation Man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling real-life footage, but unless they're also fond of pretentious, headache-inducing, experimental art-house cinema, they'll find this one a real chore to sit through.  82 minutes of ugly imagery accompanied by dis-chordant sound, terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue, this mind-numbingly awful drivel is the perfect way to test one's sanity: if you've still got all your marbles, you'll switch this rubbish off and watch something decent instead (I watched the whole thing, but am well aware that I'm completely barking!)."
1,"I was so glad I came across this short film. I'm always so disappointed that short films are hard to come across, so when I saw this and saw that it was nominated for the Live Action Short Film at the Academy Awards, I was so pleased that I actually had a film that I was rooting for.  The plot is pretty simple, the director, writer, and star Nacho Vigalondo tried coming up with a reason people would suddenly break out into a song and dance number like they do in movie musicals. The result is extremely entertaining and the song is actually really catchy.  It's a well made short film, well edited and the actors all do a great job. And the last shot of the film is perfect.  I highly recommend this film."
1,"Made me think about it for days after seeing it. That to me is the mark of a great movie. Eyes Wide Shut had the same effect on me. I am tired of these people requiring these happy Hollywood cookie-cutter endings. I am planning on going to see it again tonight to understand the plot a little better - but regardless, the emotional messages of the movie were totally felt."
2,"The Ernest films are pretty much all the same: amiable, clunky, dumb, with an inspired moment every half hour or so. This is the exception. Same writers, same production company, but for some reason they decided to forget about plausibility and go straight for surrealism -- and the result is one of the funniest movies ever made. There's a story of sorts (lots of people chasing a revolutionary war cannon purported to contain the Crown Jewels of England), and a moral of sorts (don't be afraid to risk), but they're just scaffolding for the gags and shtick. The script abounds in throwaway lines that have no relation to anything else (""I haven't seen anything like this since the Bay of Pigs""), scraps of ridiculous dialogue (the history professor sees Ernest with a possibly valuable artifact: ""Where did you get that?"" ""France."" ""Where in France?"" ""Outside Paris""), and all sorts of off-the-wall bits (the professor doing Elvis, the Mighty Workboy song). Jim Varney does a few of his standard issue klutzy-Ernest bits, but they just set the real humor in higher relief. Plus, the supporting cast is great: Tom Butler as the villain, alternately sadistic and zoned-out (""Yes...but many men died""); Ron James as the nebbishy professor (""Herpetology is not my field""); and the magnificent Linda Kash, stealing the picture as the professor's domineering wife (""Really hate that tie, dear. Really do."") I've seen this movie maybe ten times, and it gets stranger and funnier every time. If you're expecting something that makes sense, you'll be disappointed, but if you just sit back and watch the weirdness, you're in for a comic classic. 10 out of 10, no hesitation."
2,"I've seen this 4-part film at once (230 min.) and surprisingly it wasn't tiring or boring at all. On the contrary, the movie caught my attention readily, as it tells this story very well. Alex Kingston is great in the part of this young woman who struggles to be a wealthy gentlelady, even if it requires surrendering her virtue in any way. It's a wonderful movie and I strongly recommend it."
0,"I thought I had seen this movie, twice in fact. Then I read all the other reviews, and they didn't quite match up. A man and three young students, two girls and a boy, go to this town to study alleged bigfoot sightings. I still feel pretty confident that this is the movie I saw, despite the discrepancies in the reviews. Therefore I'm putting my review back: If you like the occasional 'B' movie, as I do, then Return to Boggy Creek is the movie for you! Whether it's setting the sleep timer, and nodding off to your favorite movie-bomb, or just hanging out with friends. Boggy Creek, the mute button, and you've got a fun night of improv. Look out! Is the legend true? I think we just might find out, along with a not-so-stellar cast. Will there be any equipment malfunctions at particularly key moments in the film? Does our blonde, manly, young hero have any chest hair? Will the exceptionally high-tech Technicolor last the entire film? You'll have to watch to find out for yourself."
2,"This was a story of love, lust, imperfection and redemption.  It was very funny at times, a tear-jerker at other times. Well acted. Reminded me a bit of the 1998 film ""Woo"" though this film was a LOT better. The story remains unpredictable throughout the movie.  Definitely a fun date movie."
2,"Ah, the old days when movies were really, really bad. No, wait, this was made this year... Hmm, wow, I didn't think a movie about the great American dream versus the Evil Empire (tm)(c) could hold water -- no longer the evil U.S.S.R, now it gets to be China. Nor one of those shows about how the evil alien which is about to kill everyone in the world and suddenly learns to love us because some w****r scientist kisses some gal in the heat of the moment, and leaves despite the fact that it's been shot full of holes by missles and been exposed to nothing but a constant stream of violence from the majority of the ""dominant"" human population (remember, we are great, while dinosaurs sucked!). Or one where the military so predictably wants to blow up the thing-we-don't-understand with a nuke ordered by a panicked President even though the resident scientist (who's of course a totally smug jerk) says not to. How do these awful movies keep getting made?? Isn't it possible for someone to present a good, non-predictable plotline to a Hollywood producer and actually have it made? Sigh, not going to happen, I guess..."
2,"Now you know when a film has you and is entertaining. Usually for me the indications are....1) I'm not bored 2) I'm not yawning 3) i don't have to make an excuse to goto to the toilet even when I don't need to. This film did not have me doing any of these things.  John Woo during the early to mid 90's had a range of good films in Hollywood before he went stupid during the 2000's. This along with Hard Target, Face/Off, Once a Thief and Mission Impossible 2 was one of them.  From the get go this movie had Woo written all over it....the slow motion shots, the double guns, John Travolta, and the Mexican stand off - although this time with a gun and a knife. From the opening boxing match, to the underground nuclear explosion and the climax on the train this movie thrilled.  Admittedley, as other commentators have pointed out...this is a run of the mill action movie which is elevated by John Woo, Travolta and Slater to above average. I hate to say this but I could watch this a second time and still not get bored with it.  Overall, this movie did do it for me. Great to have a pizza and a six pack on a Saturday night DVD fest with the guys."
2,"Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so I am happy to see any of their films. It is the Stone Age, 6000 years ago, and all men are forced to marry or work on the rock pile, but King Ferdinand orders all males over 13 and under 95 years must marry, or be banished, die, or both. We see an example of a marriage, in front of the law tablet, with the priest testing soul-mates, and bashing the couple's heads, literally. Arriving in the land is wizard Saxophonus (James Finlayson) with his daughter Blushing Rose (Viola Richard) and a long lasting toothache. Then along comes the Mighty Giant (Ollie) from the bogs, looking for anybody's wife, and after seeing the new law, he says he get any amount of women he wants. Trying to woo some women he gets constantly clunked on the head by a jealous man, and also a butt from a goat, so he think something doesn't want him to be with those women. Then along comes merry swain Little Twinkle Star (Stan) searching for romance, and hearing someone shout the new law, he giggles at the idea, and merrily jumping around he manages to tumble down a hill into a prickly cactus. After this Twinkle tries copying a caveman's technique for getting a girl, by picking her up and taking her away, but the girl he picks doesn't want it, and they have a kicking and tossing argument. Then Twinkle sees and chases Rose round a bush, and when he gets to her father, he will only allow a marriage if he proves himself as a provider of fish. While Twinkle goes to catch fish harpooning and using flies, Rose tries to ease her father's pain by pulling out the aching tooth with string tied to a rock. The father can't throw it, so the Giant comes along and does instead, but ends up throwing him over the cliff as well, but after tumbling, it seems it worked. Both Twinkle and Giant meet each other, and only one can have Rose with her father's permission, so they start squabbling, but Twinkle manages to send Giant off the near cliff with the help of goat's butt. After returning to Rose, Twinkle and she sit on what they think is a rock, but it turns out to be a brown bear that they wake, and running away in the cow and cart, they flip it upside down, and the film ends with the father and the couple with the bear joining them under the cart. Filled with some small slapstick and not too bad classic comedy, it isn't great, but it's a silent black and white film worth looking at. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians' Comedian. Okay!"
0,"I cannot believe that I wasted five hours of my life on this rubbish. The previous five day offering by this author was highly enjoyable and I was really looking forward to this. But most of the dialogue was completely incomprehensible. Suranne Jones was the principal culprit since she either mumbled or gabbled her lines, but most of the rest of the cast followed her example. Notable exceptions were Bernard Hill and Anne Reid, old stagers whose diction was exemplary. Do producers not listen to productions before they are aired to make sure the dialogue is audible? As a result I suppose I lost track of what was going on, and since the original plot line seemed to metamorphose into to the standard them-and-us thing between Muslims and the rest I soon lost interest. The ending was a complete anti-climax. A complete dud."
2,"This was a wonderfully shot movie, too bad the acting, plot, and direction were below average. I have seen Kim Basinger do better than this. Her performance was horrible and the rest of the cast followed suit.  The action is not linked and the characters just exist with no purpose. The movie doesn't even get interesting until the end. The watcher sits and waits through the whole movie for something significant to happen. Unfortunately, nothing really does.  I urge people not to see this movie. It is a waste of time and money. Gladiator will crush it at the box office this week. Sorry Kim...  I gave it a three because there was some effort put into it, just not enough to make an average movie."
2,"I recently viewed this movie and was left in awe at the sheer awfulness that this film portrayed. You would actually have to compliment the writers for making such a disgusting film, because to my knowledge no being who had any semblence of dignity could be capable of making such a horrible movie. Translations from the attempt at italian in this movie were terrible. In conclusion, avoid this film at all costs."
2,this movie just made me sick to the bone. it is a sick attempt to create a from dusk till dawn kinda movie. it starts of as a road movie with the pshyco killer and then goes to a bar. hmm where did i see that before.? the humor was so bad it became horrible. the guys with two guns raised ready to go out side was just crap. the pretty female being an ugly but good alien ? ohw come on what were they thinking? and the end that it all as a dream ohw please . so if you like to mess up you're day watch this movie. if u like crap that is more crap than crap watch this one and you will have a blast. and to be honest the box is better than the movie and that says enough for me .
1,"Surreal film noir released soon after the ""real,"" genre-defining classics ""The Maltese Falcon,"" ""Double Indemnity"" and ""The Postman Always Rings Twice."" Welles films shouldn't be evaluated against others. He was playing by different rules. In fact, he was playing. This starts where other femme fatale films leave off, so the vaguely logical (but interesting) whodunit is embellished with a display of Wellesian scenes (typical rapid-fire style), dialog (lots of ""hard-boiled"" philosophy), and unusual acting (good Hayworth presumably intentionally one-dimensional). To Welles ""genre"" may have meant ""formula"" but he seemed to like using ""mysteries"" as backgrounds for his ""entertainments."""
2,"I saw this movie at the Dragon*Con 2006 Independent Film Festival. It was awarded 2 awards at that festival and rightfully so. This is probably the best short horror film I've ever seen. The simplicity of camera usage really works.The main character is brilliant. His acting is quite good and is believable. The 3 cameras in the room with Tim Russel make his insanity that much more believable. I love it. I have talked with Mike and he says that they are in the process of making a feature film compassing the first three chapters together. I can't wait. I will be first in line for that film. The effects of the ""mirror"" creatures are used so well. You don't see them for very long so it scares the pants off of you when you do. I recommend this film to anyone who wants to watch a good horror movie for once. Best 32 minutes of spine tingling horror I've ever seen. Thanks Mike."
2,"Africa Screams, one of the least seen of Abbott&Costello's films was an independent production that was released through United Artists. The thin plot has Hillary Brooke believing Costello has the map to a hidden territory that is rich with diamonds. Bud and Lou go to Africa at her behest with her two companions, the fighting Baer Brothers. Of course the payoff she has in mind is different than the one boys are expecting.  Not that Universal studios exactly invested Abbott&Costello's films with much in the way of productions values, but this one is really really bad in that department. What budget they had they must have spent on getting both Clyde Beatty and Frank Buck to do guest appearances playing themselves.  On the plus side the boys do have some amusing moments, especially Costello in the cage with one of Clyde Beatty's lions which he thinks is just Abbott in a lion costume. Joe Besser and Shemp Howard also provide for some additional laughs.  My favorite moment in the film however is with the Baer brothers, Max and Buddy, both of them having fought Joe Louis and coming out on the short end, in Buddy's case twice, falling out and starting to fight as Max says he'll hit Buddy harder than Joe Louis ever did.  The film could have been a lot better, the boys are fine, but the production values give the film a look like something Ed Wood might have created."
2,"I saw this movie back in high school at age 16 and there was not a dry eye in the classroom at the end of the movie when Ben died of AIDS complications, and if I remember correctly, it was a true story. The most touching scene to me was when their fourth child was born and Ben, who was the oldest of the four boys, including the newborn, got to see him before he died. The found out that their newest son did not have hemophilia, where the blood does not clot if someone with this gets a cut. He can bleed to death if it is not treated with platelet transfusions. Ben and the other two sons did have hemophilia, and it was from a platelet transfusion that Ben got AIDS."
2,"Kenneth Branagh's poor attempt at making a film of Mary Shelley's 19th century novel 'Frankenstein' fails to give across the message that Shelley's world famous creation manages to do. The adaptation mostly follows the line of the book with the enthusiastic Professor Frankenstein who is determined to create life after his mother dies giving birth his younger brother. Despite the fact the film is based on the book it lacks the ability to ""truly curdle the blood"".  Isn't the film supposed to be a horror? Although the makeup done by Daniel Parker, Paul Engelen and Carol Hemming was pretty frightening, the film never really gave me that spine-shiver that is expected from a horror. It lacks that sense of darkness and suspense. When expecting an ending that was similar to the book's, it is very surprising to find that Branagh has changed it. The gory scene of the monster ripping Elizabeth's heart out is then followed by a laughable failure of the zombie-like Elizabeth running through the house in flames. Despite the effect's this is unrealistic and whole house is a blaze in less then a minute! There are many great actors in the film such as the multi-talented Kenneth Branagh who both directs and stars in the film, Robert De-Niro who plays the distraught creature, Tom Hulce who plays Henry Clerval (Frankenstein's closest friend) and Helena Bonham Carter who plays Elizabeth, but this still doesn't bring the film to life. Branagh's attempt of the science-obsessed professor Victor Frankenstein is first seen in the cold blizzards of the Arctic wearing a frosted fur coat. He is taken aboard by Captain Robert Walton (Aidan Quinn) and begins to narrate his life, first as a youngster and then how he came to make his hideous creation. His Frankenstein is dramatic and over-acted but doesn't bring out the enthusiasm of Victor Frankenstein described in the novel. Hugely contrasted to Branagh's attempt of Frankenstein is Robert De Niro's superb performance of the creature. His performance conveys the feelings that the creature is described to have such as hate for Victor Frankenstein and lots of sadness. The way he portrays the creature really allows the audience to feel sympathy for Frankenstein's creation.  The music seems to play throughout the whole film and is as annoying as Kenneth Branagh's loud and over the top acting. Patrick Doyle's music doesn't give the film any suspense, instead it leaves the audience trying to concentrate on the rest of the adaptation. Also it is hard trying to concentrate when the film is constantly switching from scene to scene, and it's jumpy camera is making you dizzy.  The book's sophisticated language appears very simplified as many of the words and some of the language from the book is not used, but this allows the audience to understand more of the story. However maybe if Branagh had tried less to change it and had used more of the original dialogue and narrative, the film could be more interesting and therefore hold the interest of the viewing audience longer.  In the scene after Frankenstein (Kenneth Branagh) has brought the creature to life. Frankenstein is lying in his bed, he awakes from a bad dream and the monster appears in a flash of lighting. Everybody knows this cliché from any traditional horror movie! Branagh should have paid more attention to the detail in the book and possibly produced a film much more true to it's title and not the farce that was created.  Despite the fact that there are many unimpressive sections of the film there is undoubtedly some parts which will entertain the audience, such as the making of the monster. When Frankenstein is stitching and bringing the monster together there is a sense of realism and anticipation. This bit was enjoyable but unfortunately this short interlude of excitement lasted no more then 5 minutes and soon returned to it's dull but laughable self."
2,"Excruciating sex and romance comedy wherein the romance is applied by cutting to close-ups of star Olivia de Havilland gazing at her G.I. with stars in her eyes, though the sex never happens because this is hermetically-sealed 1956 and, of course, people didn't do such things. Out to prove her Ambassador father wrong, daughter Olivia goes out on a date with soldier John Forsythe (under the guise of a French model!) to prove he isn't a ""mucker"" (or, wolf). It gets worse from there. Forsythe's chatty buddy, who sounds like he's auditioning for a cartoon voice-over job, gets chummy with a senator and his wife while Forsythe has a confrontation with every person he talks to (he's far too intense and focused an actor to relax and be easy, and these fluffball surroundings have him looking like a deer in the headlights). Norman Krasna wrote and directed this misguided comedy, one without a single laugh or single engaging character (although Myrna Loy tries). It looks good in widescreen, but the script is a piece of lead, insulting to everyone from French fan dancers to bagpipe players to horny American G.I.s who can't even take in a show without arguing with the maître d' over their restaurant cover charge. * from ****"
2,"I suppose that the IDEA of the film Henry & June is alright; you know, find yourself, discover who you are, etc., etc. ... but does it really have to involve so much prolonged sex scenes? And really, what WAS the point?  I kept on waiting for this film to actually, I don't know... begin, I suppose. It just seemed to go in circles. And just when you think that you can't take it anymore, they throw in another half an hour. I kept on thinking to myself, For God's sake, this is almost bordering on porn. All sex, and minimal pointless plot (and what good plot there was, they sure didn't focus on it as much as trying to create arousing scenes) Why don't I just leave? --- I didn't leave, although now I wish I had. I just kept on hoping that it was going to get better. But it didn't. I stayed in the end because I figured that I might as well if I had made it through the rest of it.  I thought that the actors were ok though, considering what they had to work with. But in the end presentation will never add up to substance, and substance there was not. Again, I beg of the director, What the hay was the actual point? I give Henry & June a 3 out of 10. See it if you so desire, but I REALLY don't recommend it."
2,"My two daughters (ages 5 and 2) were the luckiest girls in the world when a friend of mine gave them her original My Little Pony videotapes from the 80s. They watched them over and over again, and to keep my sanity, I let my husband buy some cheap DVDs with My Little Pony Tales, for variation.  That variation I could have done without. Much like other people here, I was disgusted by the superficial and petty characters (even though at first glance the story lines appear to offer some good values). Stripping the beloved horses of all their horse qualities and making them over like some cartoon 90210 for 12-year-olds is a crime.  My girls don't really understand much of the Tales, but they watch them anyway, since they recognize the ponies. So, I let them watch the DVD's anyway and tried to hide how much I hated them.  Until today, that is. Today I forced myself to sit and really watch an episode. It didn't take more than two minutes for one of the horses to say (while eating a carrot, perfectly normal food for a PONY) that she couldn't wait until their synchronized swimming competition was over, so they could all go back to eating ""normal food"" again!!! No, the storyline of this episode was not about dieting, this was just said to fill out some time. To my dismay I found that every episode of the horrible Tales contain such sneaky comments, creeping into the minds of my precious little girls. I don't' CARE if there's another Tales episode that shows the dangers of dieting, my girls shouldn't even THINK or KNOW about dieting.  Long story short: I'm chucking those DVDs today. And I want to advise everyone reading this to stay FAR away from My Little Pony Tales. We only get one childhood. Fantasy adventures with kind and magical horses give children the escape from reality they need. Don't throw them into the adult world too early."
2,"This is the third time i have seen this film, and i absolutely adore it :). It's so fresh, sexy and real. I would just crawl into the cinema seat, with my love and simply enjoy it. :) The photo session of the film is the one of the best, okay, they don't use such a camera and scenes to produce such shots there and then, but i don't care, it mixes great i think. The fact that both Josh and Cynthia is so usual gives the film an authentic look. :) Great sex scenes and the usual differences between man and woman on display. :)"
1,"This is a tongue in cheek movie from the very outset with a voice-over that pokes fun at everything French and then produces a rather naif but very brave hero in Fanfan La Tulipe. Portrayed by the splendid Gerard Philippe, the dashing young man believes utterly in the fate curvaceous Lollobrigida foretells - notably that he will marry King Louis XV's daughter! Problem is, La Lollo soon find outs she too is in love with Fanfan...  Propelled by good sword fights, cavalcades, and other spirited action sequences the film moves at a brisk pace and with many comic moments. The direction is perhaps the weakest aspect but the film is so light and takes itself so un-seriously that I could not give those shortcomings a second thought. Look out for Noel Roquevert, a traditional heavy in French films, trying to steal La Lollo, making himself a nuisance, and feeding the script to the fortune teller that reads La Lollo's hand! And what a gem Marcel Herrand is as the megalomanous and lust-driven King Louis XV! That is not all: So many beautiful women in one film makes me wish I were in France and on the set back in 1952! The film may have come out that year but its verve, cheek, superb narration, immaculate photography and the memorable Gerard Philippe ensure that it remains modern and a pleasure to watch. I would not hesitate to recommend it to my grandchildren let alone to anyone who loves movies in general and swashbucklers in particular! Do see it!"
2,"I have always loved documentary films and studied film in university.When a friend of mine told that there was a documentary on beauty pageants that was going to be on television, I tuned in. The first thing that struck me about this particular documentary was that it didn't have a lot of the traditional interviews and there was no voice over - instead the filmmakers developed the story through the characters themselves, and what ensues is a unique approach to this form of film-making. It's great to see a documentary film that utilizes the camera to not only document, but to compose visually stunning shots as well. The editing really brought out the drama of the film and the music was really really good. It was great to see a fresh approach to this form of film-making. May there be more films like this."
2,"The other user comment misses the point of this film entirely; Passport to Suez is not supposed to be a serious historical examination of what might have happened had the Nazis gained control of the Suez Canal, but a spy/mystery/adventure with some comedy laced in.  Warren William's final turn as Michael Lanyard is a real winner, thanks to a complex and witty script and the direction of the great Andre De Toth. The Lone Wolf films are always entertaining (with the exception of The Lone Wolf Spy Hunt, which was nearly ruined by Ida Lupino) but Passport to Suez has a classier feel than any of its predecessors. The camera-work in the film is moody and atmospheric, William's first meeting with Mr. X is very memorable, and one murder scene that takes place on an Alexandrian street is positively stunning, something Hitchcock needn't have been ashamed of. The mystery is intricate and well-meshed, and the script features a memorable array of colorful characters--Gavin Muir's friendly and urbane Nazi operative, Sheldon Leonard's slick nightclub owner, Anne Savage's femme fatale, Sig Arno's eccentric stool pigeon, Frederic Worlock's uptight British intelligence officer, Jay Novello's sleazy spy, and especially Lou Merrill's phlegmatic but deadly double-agent.  William himself handles the atypical seriousness of the plot perfectly and reins in his usual enjoyable hamminess, while Eric Blore provides impeccable comedy relief(his reaction to the mysterious phone caller at the beginning of the picture is hilarious--I feel that way with certain telemarketers).  The propaganda in the film is mercifully minuscule; it has none of the protracted speeches that popped up in the earlier Lone Wolf film Counter-Espionage. Aside from Warren's remark to Muir about the ""New European Order having no room for sentiment,"" propaganda is bypassed for sheer entertainment.  A worthy finale to William's illustrious stint as the Lone Wolf."
0,"I am stunned to discover the amount of fans this show has. Haven't said that Friends was, at best an 'average' sitcom, and not as great as others have made out. Let's face it, if it wasn't for the casting of Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston and Matt Le Blanc, then who knows whether this show would've lasted as long as it has done. I very much doubt that. Although as the series progressed, Friends got more progressively predictable, lame and boring that I couldn't care less about the characters- of whom are the most overrated in TV history- or of their plight, nor of who was sleeping with whom. And it went from being funny in the first four seasons to occasionally funny. And even when it had all these A-list Hollywood actors from the movie world, I still didn't bother to tune in. The writing in Friends became stale that I lost interest in this show from the sixth season onwards and as for the ending, well it was predictable to say the least.  What was annoying though was that this lasted for ten seasons, whilst some of my favourite shows lasted for only three, four seasons for instance and were eventually cancelled and taken off the air for good. The show should've came to an immediate halt by the time the cast wanted bigger salaries. In truth, as much as the series waned, it was the show that was bigger than the actors themselves, not the other way round.   When it ended in 2004, I was so relieved to see the back of this sitcom. Now, there is talk of a friends reunion show coming to our TV screens very soon. And yet, I for one will not be looking forward to it whatsoever."
0,"Once again a film classic has been pointlessly remade with predictably disastrous results. The title is false as is everything about this film. The period is not persuasively rendered, and the leads seem way too young and too vapid to even be criminals. Arthur Penn's film had style, humor, a point of view, and was made by talented people. Even if the 1967 version didn't exist this would still be an unnecessary film. The 1967 version strayed from the facts, presented a glamorized version of Bonnie and Clyde, but it was exciting, and innovative for 1967, and it had some outstanding performances that allowed you to care. This 1992 remake seems culled from the original film rather than the truth as known and the actors in this version are callow, unappealing, and not the least bit interesting. By all means skip this one and hope the 2010 version will be better. Could it possibly be worse?"
2,"I was really keen on seeing this film and now that i have i'm totally disappointed. The director of this movie is so ambitious to give the viewer a movie of epic proportions that he has just forgotten to put a story into it. Kitano does his best to give his two-dimensional role of the rapist/husband some depths, the other actors are all very good and the cinematography has the charm of photographs of the past but there is no possibility to actually care for any of the characters. The movie is such a bric-a-braque that you won't even learn anything at all about it's narrator, Kitanos son Masao. I have no problem with movies this violent but when you don't suppose to feel anything for the victims it is a waste of time, and for 144 Min. a very long one. In my eyes Yoichi Sai is a bad director because he hasn't put his heart into something that could have been a fascinating movie."
2,"I am afraid that this is without any shadow of a doubt the very worst film I have ever seen.  It really is truly appalling and has no redeeming features whatsoever. I am certainly not averse to watching junk, indeed some films are enjoyable precisely because they are bad. But this was is quite unbelievable.  The acting is utterly abysmal - particularly Kelly LeBrock, who is totally talent-free. The storyline stinks to high heaven and is so politically incorrect it would make even the most severe male chauvinist blush. The dialogue is truly ghastly and made me cringe on many occasions. ""Time Out"" said that it was as though two adolescents had been let loose with a camera.  I dare say many will think I am taking it too seriously. Believe me I am not. It is obviously meant to be a joke - it's just that it fails dreadfully and does not seem too aware of the miserably obnoxious underlying message it conveys."
2,"Johnny Depp is superb! He portray's his character, a somewhat eccentric, isolated writer, in his typically quirky manner. I enjoyed watching the movie just to see what he'd say or do next. I got the impression he was ad-libbing his monologues and it brought a smile to my face. The movie itself did little for me, however. It was pretty straight-forward through most of it, nothing terrific, nothing unexpected. Man shows up at door claiming Mort (Depp's character) plagiarized him. The man turns out to be a psycho, or so we think. By the way, why does the family pet always get killed? I mean, ALWAYS! In this one, it's the dog. Things get a little more interesting when Mort starts thinking that maybe his estranged wife's new boyfriend might be behind everything, that he might have sent this psycho after Mort in the hopes of speeding up the divorce but things have gotten out of control. Mort even confronts the boyfriend about it. Their conversation does not fit into the twist near the end of the movie, however. In fact, nothing fits in to the twist. It turns out that this psycho doesn't exist, it's Mort himself that has been doing everything to himself. He's mad. He killed his own dog. He killed his own neighbor, though he thought the stalker had killed him because he had seen the two of them together. Turns out the neighbor only saw Mort arguing with himself. Mort killed the detective he hired to intimidate the stalker. Okay, the twist was a good idea but it happened so abruptly that you were tempted to hit rewind to see if you missed something. And it really contradicted the conversation Mort had with the boyfriend who had admitted that things were out of his control. Or, who knows, maybe that conversation never took place either. Maybe Mort was standing at the gas station talking to himself. Okay, an interesting movie with an interesting twist if the twist had been integrated better, if clues had been given that you could later say, oh I should have seen that coming, I should have caught that. But there was no indication and so it seemed fabricated. I don't think the move will hurt Depp's reputation, however. He did a terrific acting job and, okay, I'm tempted to play a couple of parts again just to hear his quirky little jibes at himself and his wife and the boyfriend.. Glad I sat through it but I've seen better."
2,"Two English girls on a biking holiday ride through a rural portion of France, populated exclusively by sinister people. Somewhat too cleverly plotted film, with a huge red herring: one of the main characters acts in a completely irrational way simply to create confusion for the audience and lead into a kind of trick ending. Perhaps Cathy's extreme reticence is meant to be typical British reserve, but she eventually seems too self-possessed to be credible. And why bother to move the victim, when the entire location is so remote? Granted, it's well-directed and suspenseful throughout, but once it's over, the irrationalities undercut the accomplishment."
2,"OK this film has virtually no budget for a sci-fi movie and no real stars to speak of other than Peter 'Robocop' Weller but that doesn't matter because what it does have is a good story well told. It's a shame that bigger budget sci-fi productions never seem to remember that sci-fi should be have an interesting premise and not just throw a few explosions at the screen every few minutes.  What is on offer in Screamers is a solidly entertaining 1hr 40mins of sci fi fun, reasonable acting and a great story based on a Phillip K Dick short. The main idea of screamers is a very scary one a war that had been taken over by machines that fight on our behalf a war that can't be stopped.  For sci-fi fans this is a must see, for everyone else it's still solidly entertaining 7/10"
2,"Obviously, you have to judge this for what it is and that's a low budget film. The effort is certainly worthy of praise. Theo van Gogh is a gifted director, Thomas Kist a good DP and the actors do a fine job. The film's problem lies in it's screenplay. Yes, Holman has created self-conscious characters and given them confrontational, brutally honest lines that certainly exceed the quality of dialogue in the average Dutch production, but I didn't find the characters psychologically valid, especially Katja's. They never struck me as real people. Holman doesn't display a true understanding of the human psyche, which is unfortunate for a psychological thriller. Therefore, it could have been better."
2,"I recently saw Juncture at the Mill Valley Film Festival and was completely blown away. I honestly had no idea what to expect and was very pleasantly surprised. Juncture is the right combination of action, thriller, suspense and drama and it poses some very interesting moral questions. Lead lady Kristine Blackport (as Anna Carter)'s presence is unforgettable. The viewer experiences Anna's journey through the last few months of her life and what she chooses to do with that precious time. I laughed and cried with Anna. And the film definitely left me pondering about what I would do in a similar situation. It's always nice to see strong female characters presented in film. Excellent story and dialogue. Beautiful cinematography. Impressive acting. The music also was very strong and helped support the dramatic moments of the film. All in all, I highly recommend Juncture."
0,"Very strange but occasionally elegant exploitation movie with no real story, but benefiting from its stunningly ravishing lead actress and a handful of nice, gruesome make-up effects. Daniella is a beautiful twenty-something girl, carrying with her the trauma of being raped at the age of 13. Nightmares and hallucinations lead her further into believing she's the reincarnation of a female ancestor who was said to be a werewolf. She kills her brother-in-law during a nightly encounter and gets submitted in a hospital. She escapes again, however, and randomly devours more men whilst on the run for police detectives, doctors and relatives. It's all pretty to look at and listen too (really great soundtrack), but the absence of plot and continuity become irritating quite fast. Luckily enough, leading lady Annik Borel rarely ever wears clothes and she fills up the boring moments by dancing naked around a fire. The film is too long, too weird and too forgettable. The biggest surprise comes at the end, when suddenly and out of the blue, director Rino Di Silvestro tries to make us believe that his movie was based on true facts. Yeah, right..."
1,"This movie is maybe the most touching and uplifting one that I have ever seen. I am not a religious person, but sometimes a great piece of art like this movie can give me an almost religious experience. One suddenly realizes that there is really meaning to life.  I must admit that when I first heard about this movie I was sceptical. I thought the plot sounded contrived and I was afraid that the story would be banal. But being a David Lynch fan I decided to give it a go. It took me about 30 minutes to be fully captured by the movie, but then I was completely lost in it. There is so much wisdom and warmth in this movie! I left the cinema feeling that I had truly learned something valuable about life.  This is not a typical David Lynch movie, and in some ways it was very surprising that he should make such a film after exploring the dark sides of human nature for so many years. On the other hand, I am not surprised that he manages to convey deep emotions and profound human insight because I also thought he managed that very well in The Elephant Man. Lynch is one of the most gifted directors around and I think The Straight Story is his best yet. 9.5/10"
2,"""X-men"" is a well done sci-fi action film for all action fans: especially for those who as kids dreamed of having special powers themselves. Each of the main mutant characters has a special ability and during the film I sometimes found myself thinking about which of those abilities I would choose if I were given the chance. Of course all of those special abilities are visible in the film's spectacular special effects. But the special effects were not the only thing that made watching this film fun. There is also plenty of action and character interaction besides shooting and beating and using special powers. As each mutant character is given a past (to give him a motivation) and a weakness, the film's plot never got boring because I also wanted to know how things developed between the mutants themselves.  And I won't even talk about the ending. It actually surprised me. But go see for yourself"
1,"Let us begin by saying that this film's English title ""The Power of Kangwon Province"" is an absolute misnomer.It is because in Hong Sang Soo's film,there are no actual shots of wars,troubles and conflicts.So the idea of establishing power of a province is neither suitable nor valid in the context of this film.If we were to judge this film by its Korean language title,""Kangwon-do ui him"" is going to appear as a cryptic statement about emotional turmoils of its young protagonists whose minds are not at rest.Hong Sang Soo has also directed a highly prolific visual document about erratic choices made by people in their lives.The people in question are a couple of young girls who are constantly in the process of displaying their moods,whims and fancies. If making a film out of nothingness can be claimed as a film maker's meritorious virtue then Hong Sang Soo has to be saluted as a courageous film maker whose films speak volumes about ubiquitous nothingness of human relationships,sentiments and lives.Whether one likes it or not,this is the only fair conclusion that be deduced from this particular film."
1,"I rented this film because of my interest in American history, and especially the somewhat weird story of the Mormons. This movie attempts to make some sense out of how Joseph Smith could turn his ""vision"" into a major world religion. It first focuses on the troubles the Mormons had in their settlement at Navuoo, Illinois. It portrays the trial of Joseph Smith. Within the course of that trial, Brigham Young stands up to tell of his conversion to Mormonism, and of his belief in the spiritual message of Smith. Then Smith is assassinated, and Young must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the Mormons to a new land. Despite his grave doubts, he perseveres, and finally has a vision (that Utah is the place for his colony) that gives him confidence in the rightness of his leadership. Later, as crops are destroyed by crickets, he again doubts that he has truly been chosen--however, a miracle occurs, which cements his place in history.  I found the performances to be moving, and the story to be convincing and interesting. I would love to know whether Mormons believe that this is an accurate portrayal. Polygamy is a part of the story, but the reasons why this is central to LDS are not raised. The issue is not emphasized.  I'm sure people stay away from this movie because of its religious subject-matter, but it has a great cast and will hold your interest throughout."
2,"Simply put, the film has as much resemblance to the book as the American Godzilla film has to the original.  The book, which is actually written by R. Chetwynd Hayes, is much better. Had they remained faithful to it, people might have had a finer opinion of the film.  The movie only has one story from the book, ""The Humgoo."" The other two tales either are a mishmash of two stories, ""The Mock"" and ""The Shadmock,"" or aren't in the book at all (that horrid tale about the boy whose father is a vampire).  If only the filmmakers had included ""The Vampire & The Werewolf,"" it might have done better.  As it stands, though, you won't be doing yourself any favors by watching this piece of crud. Feel for John Carradine and Vincent Price, as they don't really seem to be enjoying themselves.  Read the book."
2,"At last this gem of gem's will be on DVD with the debut of the Joan Crawford Collection Vol 2. One can only hope that this is released in its original widescreen format and has been remastered. The VHS print is a little worn and I can hardly wait to the see the extras.  This movie is so bad its a must see, this movie is Joan in color and on steroids as she bulldozes her way through the film. This is camp at camps best. Who else can order ""Lobster Newberg and Coffee"" for lunch at the studio cafeteria with a straight face other than Crawford... For die hard fans of Joan's more camp later years this one will keep you in stitches."
2,"I cannot believe all I'm reading about this movie comes from people who claim it was beautiful and well-done. It was well done, all right, if you ignored the tedious lines, the ""absurd theater"" construction and the utter lack of imagination which rendered the situations as completely uninspired and made you go ""ahhh come on..."" I will not even waste my time on explaining all the reasons I thought this movie was purely awful, I just want to know how anybody can think it was beautiful, clever or touching... And I would also like to know how a movie which is as ""real"" as Liz's life is considered authentic and worth watching. Everything in there is completely unauthentic, situations are poorly constructed, the love story is a sick twisted tale which escapes the rules of common reasonable sense, and that does not make the movie great. When a movie surprises you it just becomes unpredictable and that effect can be easily obtained once you completely turn a situation upside down, this does not mean that if you are taken by surprise you should bow to the imagination of the writer.  God, this was one of the worst ever. EVER"
2,"Very well made TV movie, with 3 different stories. the first stars Roddy McDowall as a bastard nephew who kills his uncle to take his money, then is haunted by the ghost of the uncle (or so he thinks) to death. Ossie Davis also stars in this episode, and he's wonderful. This is my personal favorite of the three. Roddy is snide and sly as the nephew, and when he starts to come unhinged he's marvelous. The second stars Richard Kiel as a WWII concentration camp captain hiding in some South American city, where he becomes strangely fixated with an idyllic painting of a man fishing in a mountain lake. The painting hangs in a museum, and he spends day after day in there just staring at it and eventually feels himself drawn into the painting. It's a relief to be hounded no longer by the war crimes police when he's in the painting. But back in reality he's recognized as a Nazi who was condemned after the war, and a former camp inmate tells the police about him. Kiel runs to the museum, intent on going into the life in the painting for good. But he makes a big, big mistake and will spend eternity paying for it and his crimes against humanity. The last episode stars Joan Crawford in a pretty much one-woman play. She's a blind rich woman, living in a huge penthouse apartment in NYC, who pays a loser for his corneas so that she can have them transplanted in her eyes. The kicker is that she will only be able to see for about 8 hours, and she doesn't care a bit that the man she takes the corneas from will be blind forever. She has the operation, and when the time comes to take the bandages off, the instant she does the city is plunged into a blackout. She spends the 8 hours trying to get out of the apartment building in the dark stairwells, and finally makes it back to her apartment when the sun comes up. She finally sees the sun, but it's the last thing she does.  I love this movie; and I also loved Night Gallery, but this film has 3 different viewpoints and would appeal to a large audience. All the performances are excellent. Steven Spielberg directed the Joan Crawford segment, ""Eyes""; it was one of his first director assignments."
2,"Before the Great Fire and the Great Plague of the mid-seventeenth century, London slowly, joyously awoke to the end of the Interregnum, that dark period of the evil regicide, Cromwell and his dull and dim son and successor. Theaters shut down during the Protectorate now reopened and the die-hard, dour Puritans either doffed their somber garb and decamped for more favorable vice-free venues or joined the fun.  Director Richard Eyre and script author Jeffrey Hatcher (who wrote the play on which ""Stage Beauty"" is derived) set the screen with a feast of authentic costumes and an almost palpable ambiance of a great city resurrecting a rich cultural life, at least for those of means.  But, as has been said, the play is the thing and the acting here is uniformly engrossing, indeed superb.  Based more or less on history, the film chronicles an awkward and for many painful evolution of law and theater, the two intertwined. For when Charles II was restored to the throne lost by his father (who also lost something else of even more estimable value), theaters reopened but under an old law that forbade the presence of actresses on the stage. The great female roles of Shakespeare were performed by men, some of whom were the subjects of audience and patron adulation for their skills of gender mimicry.  Ned Keynaston (Billy Crudop) is the leader of the pack, a star of the stage whose Desdemona is the height of his career. Serving as his dresser is Maria (Clair Danes), a frustrated actress who mouths the lines of Desdemona from the side of the stage as Ned wows the punters.  Maria actually gets to act behind Ned's back but in a less than first-line theater, her costume borrowed, to be generous, from the unsuspecting Ned.  What follows is a comedy and a drama as the king (Rupert Everett), at the urging of one of his mistresses, Nell Gynn (newcomer Zoe Tapper) proclaims that women may take on the roles of their sex and the cadre of female impersonators must seek new and gender authentic roles. At first amused, then devastated by a loss of roles, income and prestige, Ned slides to singing bawdy songs in drag to a somewhat low(er) class clientele in a sink run by a foulmouthed harridan. But under the protection of a genuinely odious, rotund and foul Sir Charles (Richard Griffith), Maria becomes the toast of the town for her fine acting.  Sexual attraction equally matched by a moving ambiguity permeates both the roles played by Maria and Ned and their off-stage lives. Maria is in love with Ned who is, at least, potentially bisexual while actually intimate with one of the king's favorites, the second Duke of Buckingham (Ben Chaplin). Buckingham was, in actuality, one of the most complex characters during Charles's two decade exile and then restoration to the throne. A conniver and master manipulator, here his skills are shown as being wholly adapted to surviving in a court attended by intrigue at every turn.  Eyre projects role reversal both with Ned and Maria's theater life and their increasing personal but never simple involvement. Can he make love to a woman? Does he know himself what his orientation is? There is a certain contemporaneity to the artfully acted issues raised in this mid-1600s scenario.  Eyre could not have selected a better cast. Crudop is penetrating as a man whose whole, strange persona is transformed in an instant by a monarch's command. Everett is disarmingly foppish as the Stuart monarch but in a critical scene he reveals his deep, lasting resentment over his father's and his dynasty's fate as he orders women to be allowed to perform. Edward Fox is splendid in short takes as Charles's key minister, Sir Edward Hyde (the Earl of Clarendon but he's never identified with his proper peerage title).  Zoe Tapper may well have studied the life of her character, ""the Protestant Whore"" (so known and loved by the London underclass to distinguish her from the despised ""Catholic Whore"" who alternated with Nell for the king's company and body (forget about the queen-she doesn't even make an appearance here). She's crude, raw, vulgar, sentimental, loyal and cunning - she IS Nell Gynn.   Hugh Bonneville is the randy, compulsive diarist Sir Samuel Pepys, father of the Royal Navy, here a stage door Johnny, a voyeur. Ben Chaplin as the Duke of Buckingham is just the right admixture of randiness and a healthy regard for the penalty that can be incurred by going too far over the edge of conventionality. And Tom Wilkinson as Ned's and then Maria's stage impresario combines business acumen with a soft human touch.  But special kudos go to Clair Danes - this is her best performance to date. She runs the gamut of emotions from helpless subservience to repressive laws to sprightly awakening of her worth to deep confusion about her priorities and needs. She inhabits the role of Maria with skill and grace. An Oscar-worthy display.  The score is fine, briskly and authentically complementing the story. And for the first time ever in a movie a king of England is shown cavorting in the royal rack with his mistress while six adorable King Charles Spaniels look on.  10/10"
2,"This series was just not working for me - Neither characters, cast, storyline, nor jokes did it for me. Sorry. I would like to stop here, but since IMDb requires 10 lines of text in every comment, here goes... The series bugged me, but maybe that's because I'm not too fond of series and fond of sci-fi movies. I think, in order to have anything work in a sci-fi setting, you have to make an extra effort to put in something new for the geeky outfits etc. to work. For me, Star Wars pulled it off most of the time (although my wife would probably argue), Star Trek never quite did it for me [""Captain, we've never seen anything like this life force before"" -""Oh, well I have, last episode""] Red Dwarf doesn't pull it off, it's neither funny, nor new in its sci-fi ways, but it takes the price as the only blend of Space Balls, Eastenders, herbal tea, and James Brown. And since sci-fi comedy series has not been done a lot, I guess there is something new here after all - so I give it a 3. Cheers."
2,"Henry Shoesmith is THE PAGAN, a happy, handsome half-caste, perfectly attune with his South Seas home. Henry is also the owner of the largest cocoanut plantation on the island, which arouses the greed of an unscrupulous white trader with a beautiful native 'ward'...  Ramon Novarro is charming in this, his final silent film. Once again, MGM has their Mexican star playing another in his wide range of ethnic roles. Here he is a Polynesian, but he plays his part so well, and is obviously having such a good time, that he gives one of his most entertaining of performances.  He is served well by his excellent supporting cast. Dorothy Janis is Novarro's beautiful love interest - innocent, vulnerable & passionately in love. Donald Crisp is superb as the villainous white trader, consumed with lust for the girl he calls his 'Christian duty' and embittered with hatred for Novarro. His final fate is most proper & welcome. Renée Adorée scores as the island harlot, a staunch friend to both Novarro & Janis.  Directed by peripatetic W. S. Van Dyke, the location filming in & around Papeete, Tahiti enhances the story greatly.  Coming as it did at the very cusp of the new talkie era, this is essentially a silent film with an effective soundtrack that includes musical interludes & background dialogue. Novarro croons 'Pagan Love Song' (by Nacio Herb Brown & Arthur Freed) to good effect - giving Hollywood one of its first hit tunes - and his fine singing voice would be heard again in forthcoming films."
2,"I bought this film for nothing in a Chinese market and sat down to watch it. The only thing on the cover in English was the title. For the first ten minutes I was trying to decide whether this film had been made by some kind of movie school in the UK or not, but to my growing joy I was proved wrong.   Set in some town in New Zealand(Aukland maybe), the film is basically about a day in the life of a bunch of 'hard men/wise boys' out to get back something stolen from their leader in a mugging. The story has obvious flaws - but tell me one that doesn't.  The dialogue is absolutely spot on. This is how we really speak. At least the gentlemen I know speak like this ""you're a knob jockey"" being a fine example that comes to mind.  Upon close of the film I found I had come across a great bunch of characters and all in their own way likable and recognisable from my own experiences. The lead duo I thought were superb, and you can tell while watching the film they were enjoying themselves. It's all done with a great sense of fun and lust for life.   If you are interested in watching a well made film, full action, great dialogue, magic characters, funny as hell - and without the biblical references, social pap, bare knuckle fighting and blood (although Mr Richie does this well) political correctness, etc. etc. - then here it be. Marvelous work! Lets have another one."
2,"1st watched 8/17/2003 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Cheh Chang) Kung Fu fighting from start to finish in this Hong Kong film. So I guess if you enjoy this, then you may like the movie, but I personally couldn't follow who was fighting for who from one scene to the next. From what I could tell this movie was about a couple of rival tribes battle over bragging rights for something(I'm not sure what). There was a lot of interesting props used in the fighting sequences which made it interesting to watch at times with a few bloody surprises thrown in for free. But all-in-all as a movie, this was not that exciting. It was kind of like watching a Kung Fu match with different costumes and in a way and was more like watching a sporting event instead of a movie. With that said, bypass this one if you can."
0,"This kind of storytelling is unacceptable The only reason this film is anywhere above the 5 stars out of 10 line is because it's got George Lucas behind it, and it has the words ""Star"" and ""Wars"" in its title. That is an insult to aspiring filmmakers, and many others out there who have made clearly superior films with superior story, writing and acting, but did not get the credit. This is a travesty.  First things first. The story. Anakin's evolution? There is none. Apart from a little make-up around the eyes, and a little yelling, there is none. He becomes young, stupid, cocky Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader in a single blow. The only thing consistent about Darth Vader in the original series was his intelligence, how good he was at almost everything he did, planning, fighting, you name it. The only consistent thing about Anakin that is perceived in the prequel trilogy is his consistent stupidity. He even loses his body because of a bout of stupid cockiness.  What part of the Emperor Palpatine telling him legends of the Sith does not point to the Emperor being a Sith? Unacceptable!  The fight scenes used too many digital doubles. Everyone's flying all over the place like teddy bears in a make-believe doll house. Count Dooku, Emperor Palpatine, Anakin, Obi-Wan, almost every fighter had a rubbery digital double jumping around.  In one specific fight scene, Obi-Wan and Anakin in the climactic battle, they both actually stop in the middle of parries and ripostes, to twirl their sabers a few times while inches apart. I realize the fights are choreographed, but that just got me shaking my head in disbelief and disgust.  The writing was awful. All the dialogue was of tremendously low quality. The good actors like Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman did the best they could with their lines, but that just wasn't enough. I can't say enough bad things about this film. Too much special effects, plot holes bigger than the centre of the universe, and absolutely no insights into any of the characters. This is the biggest mistake of this film: nothing new is offered. We know the rough picture of everything, all Lucas did was colour it in.  We knew Anakin lost his limbs. We knew Luke and Leia are brother and sister, we knew Luke is Anakin's son, we knew Obi-Wan and Yoda go to exile, we knew everything. Nothing new is offered in this film. If that's all the fans wanted, then that's fine, Lucas couldn't have gone wrong.  But when Anakin finally becomes Darth Vader, and he asks after Padme, and hears she is dead, he reaches out his arms awkwardly and screams ""Nooooooooooooooooooooo."" That scene screamed B-movie all the way, and I was half expecting Darth Vader to go ""DANGER WILL ROBINSON, DANGER"" at any time. That is what this is. A B-movie, disguised by a huge budget and a ultra-loyalist fan base that will settle with anything now that the first two movies have pulled their standards down to the pits of the Earth."
2,"Hey, we all loved 'Rudy' and gladly accepted the sub-par acting due to the fact that she was so young at the time. But that was a long time ago. For those of you that did see this movie, you most likely sat through it praying that Cliff Huxtable would make an irrelevant but much-needed cameo appearance to the film to give it at least some A-level acting. The plot was predictable, the emotional outbursts obviously phony, and the only thing comforting about this movie was to see the attractive face of 'Ray-J' Norwood step into a scene and make the young teenage girls and boys scream to the top of their lungs while watching it in their rooms (at least someone enjoyed it). On the plus side (and I include a plus side just because it is the right thing to do), it was nice to see Keshia Knight-Pulliam's return to TV and at the same time have a positive holiday movie that the whole family could sit down and enjoy."
2,"Every once in a while, you see a movie so dull and so stupid, you have to wonder if drugs were somehow involved in making the film. 'Exposed' is one of those films.  The plot of this film doesn't unravel, it oozes like molasses in January. Nastassja Kinski plays a Wisconsin farm girl named Elizabeth who leaves home and runs away to New York. After being discovered by a fashion photographer (McShane) she is whisked away into the glamorous world of fashion. Soon she's in Europe, and is recruited by a mysterious violin player (the awful corpse-like Rudolf Nureyev) to infiltrate a terrorist organization and kill it's leader. The leader is played by Harvey Keitel, who is given next to nothing to do.  The only good scene is at the very beginning when two terrorist babes blow up a Parisian restaurant. But it all goes downhill from there. In more capable hands and with a better cast, this film could have been good. But everything is a mess. The script is convoluted and boring, the acting is atrocious, the direction is flat, there is no suspense, and no characters that seem even human.  Oddly, so many people seem to praise Nastassja Kinski as a great actress. I've just never seen it. In every film I've seen her in she just seems vacant and bored, but this is Kinski at her worst, no doubt."
2,"Having just finished visiting Thailand myself, I too had seen a lot of falangs walking around, intimately, with these young girls and even boys. I had not realised that these Thai boys and girls were probably prostitutes as I just innocently thought they were probably couples. How wrong was I! While this documentary received a number of negative comments on how ""shallow"" it is, I seem to think that this documentary aims not to point out the problem, but as a reminder of how we, visitors and guests to the country are exploiting its resources negatively.  Thailand is a very beautiful country and I visit there quite often. I do things like shopping, eating and sightseeing. My last visit was filled with fun and joy with my friends, just doing shopping and indulging in the delicious food.  I don't agree with the British interviewee in the documentary that Thailand is a country for men. I enjoyed Thailand as much without any ""use"" of the sex trade."
2,"I had never seen any trailers or read any reviews of 'Frequency' so when it was there to be watched on a Saturday evening on a satellite movie channel, the synopsis sounded interesting so I settled down to watch 'another movie'.  Boy, did I get a surprise. My wife was working in the other room and half way through the film came in to see why I was standing up shouting at the screen! ""SATCH! LOOK AT THE BASEBALL GAME ON THE TV FOR THE SHOE POLISH BALL... NOW!!"", I shouted! I have never got so wrapped up in a film before that has caused me to react in such a way.  A month later it was repeated and my wife and eldest child sat and watched it with me to see what all the fuss was about. Like I had been (and was again) they were completely engrossed and openly declared 'frequency' to be a massive hit and 'one of the best they had ever seen'.  After scanning some reviews on IMDB I cannot understand what some people expect from a movie. If I want to be factually informed, I watch a documentary or read a book. If I want to want to watch something that accurately reflects reality, I watch a 'fly on the wall', or read a biography. If I want to be entertained, I watch a movie. One thing for sure is that 'Frequency' entertained me thoroughly and moved me too and, unlike the grizzlers of this world, I am not ashamed to say it.  It has suspense, emotion, plot twists, characters you like and an enjoyable ending. What more could you ask for. Its a sad reflection on our society that some people actually wanted a different ending.  Its an excellent movie that will be in my DVD collection by lunchtime Monday. Amongst my top three ever, I will watch it again and again."
2,"The book was told from the viewpoint of Black Beauty, and focused primarily on what happened to him and the other animals. If there's any story that demands talking animals, then it's this one. While they didn't have CGI back in the 1970s, they could have done something similar to Mr. Ed.  This show suffers from a major change in focus from the book. It's not about Black Beauty. It's about the humans in the story, plus some extra characters they threw in.  It's like making a show or movie based on the novel Traveller by Richard Adams and having it focus on General Lee.  The show was pretty, and the acting was good, but I can't give this show a good rating. A show supposedly based on the novel should actually be about Black Beauty, not about the parade of humans that passed through his life."
0,"Bad acting, bad lighting, bad plot!! This had the quality of a porno movie. I have seen more interesting home video of a boring wedding than this movie...it sucked big time!! Don't waste your time or money on this crap! It's amazing that they allow this kind of smut to even be released on video, it should be a crime!!"
2,I agree with last comment. It is formula movie with copy of western songs and dances in the hope of appealing to NRIs who may be nostalgic or those who aspire to be an NRI. This is obvious when Devgan talks in terms of $ instead of Rs to explain the exchange rate.   Every one seems to be overacting and insincere. Devgan is not only a builder but suddenly he is shown to be expert in every business so that he can send Kapoor to Thailand instead of Singapore for horticultural research. Thailand is shown to be a technologically advanced while India is still so backward.  You may watch it if you have nothing better to do.
2,This is my second favorite Christmas Carol. My first being Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol. I loved Alastair Sims as Scrooge. I know it's on alot at Christmas but I only got a chance to see it once this year so I just ordered it online. I was not able to find it in any of my local stores. My sister-in-law loves the George C. Scott version better so we always argue about which one is best. Her version doesn't hold a candle to this one as far as I'm concerned! I loved the ghosts and the whole thing and especially his housekeeper!!
2,"Rarely have I seen a film start out slower than MONDO TRASHO. It is so amateurishly made and acted that it seems that calling it a movie is a misnomer. Instead, it's like a very, very, very long and ponderous home movie made by escaped inmates of a mental asylum--and desperately needed editing and direction. What little dialog the film has is added (very, very, very poorly) after the fact.  The film begins with a hooded guy torturing and killing chickens with an ax. Why?! I dunno. It seems pretty cruel to use animals like this and I assume that Waters was just trying to shock the viewers. I hope they at least ate the chickens, otherwise this is even more tragic (at least for the chickens).  Mary Vivian Pearce goes for a walk, catches a bus, sits on a bench reading a book and walks through Johns Hopkins University for twelve minutes--with no laughs or weirdness. I can't believe that most audiences sat through this portion to see the rest of the film! Especially since it was obviously shot with a home movie camera and the sound track consisted of mostly choppy clips of random tunes strung together--some exceptional (such as the jazzy or early rock pieces) and some banal (such as ""Pomp and Circumstance"") and some oddly ironic (such as ""See Ya Later Alligator"") that dominated the images.  Eventually, a pervert with a foot fetish sneaks up and begins fondling her feet. Apparently, she's into that and they sneak off into the woods for some toe sucking (whatever floats your boat). Some loud moaning ensues--so far the only sounds other than music in the film. During the loud moaning, the scene becomes a flashback or dream or fantasy where Pearce is a modern Cinderella being abused by her step-sisters. They beat her up and strip her partially naked--then the Prince enters with the slipper and the story continues. Abruptly, however, the toe sucker is done and just walks away--leaving Pearce unsatisfied and lonely.  Divine then is shown driving along in an amazingly cool old Cadillac. She sees a naked man and backs up--right into Pearce. So, Divine picks up Pearce and puts her in the car and drives home. Then, we are treated to Divine shopping and you assume Pearce is still lying in the car bleeding. This shopping scene, like the rest of the film, went on way too long with no payoff.   For some excitement, Divine shoplifts and then quickly leaves the store. On the way out, she sees a homeless lady sleeping (or maybe she's just an unconscious lady)--and she steals her shoes! Only after this does she go back to the car to get Pearce. You think she is going to help, but actually drags her into a laundromat and strips her--stealing Pearce's clothes and putting the shoplifted clothes and the shoes on Pearce?! The Virgin Mary then appears (naturally) and you hear a voice over of Divine repenting in spasms and asking Mary for help and forgiveness. Subtle it ain't.  Using a wheelchair, Divine wheels Pearce away and they meet up with a mental patient who is accosted by guys dressed as attendants carrying a big net (wow, what an image). After capturing the nutty lady, they chase Divine and Pearce and take them to a ""hospital"" that is really just some house. There, lots of John Waters' friends roam doing rather random stuff as Pearce lays there looking comatose. Then a flat-chested lady dances (for a very long time) as the patients cheer. Eventually, she's molested and once again, Mary appears! Apparently everyone there can see her and Divine once again spasms and overacts like she did earlier. Mary's friend or a demon (who can tell?) then appears and gives Divine a switchblade and everyone escapes--with Divine pushing Pearce away in the wheelchair.  Now, finally, Divine calls a doctor for Pearce (Dr. Coathanger). Once at the office, they just sit there waiting with the other patients (never mind that Pearce was run over) until one of them takes off her clothes and some long-haired guy grabs her. Is he the doctor? No, that would be David Lochary (who is shown shooting up some drug) who proceeds to pull out giant saws and operates--as the nurse vomits. In the end, Pearce awakens and her feet are now horrific looking.  Reporters then come to interview Divine about the accident. A cop then arrives and begins beating Divine. A gun and knife battle then ensues involving lots of extras. Divine is stabbed and the cop is killed. Then, Lochary, Divine and Pearce escape in a car. Pearce and Divine are later dropped off in the middle of no where. Finding their way to a farm, they climb into a pig enclosure and roll around in the mud--until, once again, Mary shows up with Jesus. Divine is dead and Pearce wanders off--finding her way back to town.  In a way, way too long final scene, two ladies stare at her and seem to talk about Pearce--calling her lots of slutty names. The dialog is pretty funny, but is just slapped on the scene with no regard to synchronizing it to the actors lips or expression.  Overall, this nearly 90 minute film, like my review, could use a severe editing. It is amateurish and bad--with only a few funny scenes spread thinly through the film. Unless you are a die-hard Waters fan or absolutely need to see one of his earliest films, this is one you can skip. The only positive thing I can say about it is that it helped John Waters and the actors(?) to hone their craft--eventually leading to such brilliant non-conformist films as FEMALE TROUBLE and POLYESTER.  By the way, seeing Lochary shooting up is pretty sad, as he later died due to his drug use."
2,"Exposed showcases Nastassja Kinski's enigmatic beauty. She is beauty without ego. A rare trait in this day and age of vanity ridden films. Her presence is most rewarding in a rather awkward film. James Toback directed the film to showcase Kinski and expected her to become a superstar after it's release. This did not happen.   Kinski is a phenomenon on screen and is a perfect example of star presence. She did it in Polanksi's handsome Tess, Wender's, Paris Texas, and Coppola's One From The Heart. However, it is Toback's Exposed that captures her primitive nature at its core. Her exotic beauty combined with an esoteric knowledge hidden behind those dark eyes is intimidating and hypnotic. It was if Director Toback said to Kinski: "" Just be yourself."" It is unique to witness how this actress can be captured so unattractive then in the right light become the most radiant unusual striking figure of defined beauty. This is what the famous directors who seduced her saw in her.   There is something very sexy about the film as Kinski gets transformed from farm girl to high fashion model. Beauty and the beast unfold as idealism and terrorism seduce young sexy women to act out their rebel idealistic cause in a Capitalistic world. It is understandable why two Romantic Men would pursue such a cover girl as Kinski. She is exquisite at times and striking to the senses. She plays a free spirit very well, a Goddess to the nymph.   The film has some cool 60's rock interwoven in the story, :""Locomotion"" and ""La Bamba"" play as Kinski discovers her new world. The Shoop Shoop Song by Betty Everett has Kinski dancing alone to the spirits of desire.  Rudolph Nureyev has a perverse sexiness that somehow balances Kinski's exotic nature. He plays her like a violin to foul a terrorist who killed his father. There is a scene where they look like vampires as pretense surrounds Published photos in a gallery showcasing Kinski. Shame on Toback for not drawing us nearer or shame on the photographer for allowing pettiness not to allow the camera to explore the photos. It was a pivotal moment in the film to prove to the audience why this actress was the ""one.""   Toback keeps the viewer away at times from the action. It was as if he could only do one take.  Exposed is alluring like it's star. Don't even pay attention to the world that surrounds Kinski. Just watch her. She has been Exposed."
2,"Cop is based on the book 'Blood and the Moon' by James Ellroy. I have not read the book that the film is based on; although I am a big fan of the first three books in Ellroy's 'L.A. Quartet'. It is often said of Ellroy that his writing got better as it went along; and assuming that this film is closely based on the book, I would say that there's a good chance that is true as the story here is not exactly solid. The entire film hinges on one major and quite unbelievable coincidence that boggles the mind if you care to think about it. However, it's the style and atmosphere that saves it; and that's the main reason I loved this film! The plot focuses on your everyday hard-bitten cop, Lloyd Hopkins, who after investigating the murder of a woman in Los Angeles, comes to believe that a serial killer may be operating in the area. Naturally, the police captain doesn't believe a word of it and Lloyd is forced to investigate on his own; leading him to a revelation closer to home than he was expecting.  Director James B. Harris creates a fabulous atmosphere for the film to take place in and ensures that L.A. seems to be every bit the gritty and sleazy location needed to facilitate a tale like this. Similarly, James Woods fits the central role like a glove and is always believable in the role; even when the plot is getting out of hand. The first half of the film is really rather good and plausible; but then the twist hits and it really requires a suspension of disbelief from the viewer. It's not that the twist could not happen; it's more the way that it does happen which comes off as silly. It's just far too convenient and the whole film is turned on its head from that point on. Still, the atmosphere is retained and the story continues to be gripping; which are the film's strongest elements. Certain elements of the film are rather nasty, and indeed the book was originally denied by many different publishers for being too graphic! Still, a lot of it focuses on dialogue and from what I know of Ellroy, this part of the film is quite faithful. It all boils down to a rather hurried and coincidental ending; but I really do feel that this is a film where the style of it is much more important than the plot line. For some it will no doubt be too much of a problem...but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone that enjoys a good crime thriller!"
2,"I caught this movie on TCM during a tribute to the director Le Cava and was stunned and surprised by its trenchant wit and charm. The movie focuses on the obvious fact that adolescents and teenagers and kids in college spend an inordinately high portion of their waking hours thinking about sex. This is a wonderful breath of fresh air and shows that teen sexuality need not be told on screen by the use of a deus ex machina like the pathetic loser Lucas in ""Lucas"" and, alternatively, by genuinely depraved social deviants as in ""American Pie"" or ""Porky's"". Though this movie is about sex it is suitable for family viewing and even by pre teens. There is also to me a bigger message about the danger of censorship in our society. In an era where prudery and censorship are more and more being viewed by politicians as a way to protect ourselves from ourselves it may be useful to consider how much damage was done to our posterity by the Hays code and the Catholic League. Watch this movie!"
2,"This film has gained a lot of notoriety for being the first movie made in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban. Fortunately, the hype was well-deserved because this is indeed an excellent movie. The film tells the story of a little girl who masquerades as a boy in order to earn a living (under Taliban ruling, women have no rights). It is a highly politicized movie, but I did not care much for that aspect of the movie. I rather prefer to see the film as an unusual coming-of-age story. The cast of non-professional actors perform well, specially the girl who plays the title character (the camera is in love with her). My only complaint is that director Barmak could not avoid the temptation of preaching to the audience. Not that a little preaching bothers me, but I think the material is strong enough to speak for itself, and we did not need the director to tell us what we can see clearly. Overall, I did think Barmak handled the material in a brilliant manner. At the very least, the film provides a fascinating peek into another culture. Very downbeat, but sincere and always interesting. The movie is not a pleasant viewing experience, but it is an eye-opener to a sad situation. Highly Recommended!"
2,"Most of the movie is sadly rather underdone. Seems they had a somewhat interesting concept and just rushed it to the finish line. I am guessing they thought of the ending first and wrote a bunch of filler to get to said ending. So what do we get for most of the film? A rather good cast doing nothing more than going out to the abandoned town and getting themselves kidnapped by the evil cult led by Ernest Borgainine in a rather good over the top performance. You know a movie is in trouble when it seems they are rushing things so no startling revelations here, only lets rush to the cool ending. Which is the highlight of the film, a rain that comes down and washes the cult members away, rather good effects, especially for the time, but this does not make up for the rest of the film. Which leads to a question I have, why are movies about Satan and his cults usually so bloody boring or bad for the most part? You would think these movies would be some of the most gory and scary the horror genre had to offer, but usually it falls flat. Still if you do watch the movie look out for the many stars who apparently had nothing else better to do."
2,"Fist of the North Star is one of your typical, small budget action flicks which seem to appear from no where without any specific reason. I actually liked it during the first couple of minutes during the time, when the main character, Kenshiro (Gary Daniels) hadn't opened his mouth yet, but after he spoke and revealed, that besides the looks he hadn't slightest bit of acting talent I quickly stopped liking it.  My favourite scene of the film is when a Finnish ex-WWF wrestler and a (yes sad but true) member of parliament Tony Halme gets the smirk kicked out of his face. Literally. Small scene, I know, but I found it hilarious.  FOTNS is total waste of Malcolm McDowell's abilities, and as such as it is, it can only be seen as a curiosity for his fans. Maybe the fans of original graphical novel will get something else out of this film."
2,"This could have titled ""Issac Newton"" because the story bears about as much of a resemblance to his life as it does that of Wyatt Earp's. Some filmmakers will never learn that the truth or a semblance of it can be just as interesting as their imagination. This movie is a historically inacurate tale purporting to be about Earp and is actually nothing more than a plotless, western soap opera with some shootings. I gave it a 2 out of 10 instead of a 1 simply because the visual effects and cinematography are good."
2,"I liked the first one. The second one was pretty much just an excuse to show as many boobs as possible. The third one definitely exceeded both the second film and my expectations. Honestly they should have left the story where it was at the end of species three.  This movie had almost nothing to do with the first three. None of the same characters and it doesn't explain how the scientists got there hands on the alien DNA. The idea's not bad, but after the first chase scene in the streets of Mexico the movie shifts to a series of dimly-lit night sequences which make it hard to even understand what's going on.   And let's be honest here: a large focal point/selling factor for this series is the sexuality that goes along with these reproducing aliens. The nude scenes were pretty pointless in this film. There was enough shown to attempt some arousal but the lighting was so bad that it's hard to make out what's even happening. If they wanted an excuse for nudity they should have lit the stages better. If they wanted to just convey the sexual point in the story they shouldn't have filmed full body sex.  Basically if you were happy with how they ended number 3, don't waste your emotions getting involved with these unrelated characters. If you just wanted to see boobs, pick a different movie.  Either way steer clear because you'll be disappointed no later than halfway through the film."
1,"Being from Canada, I cannot say whether this film is original in the context of Danish cinema - unfortunately, we, here, do not get to see many Danish films in a year! I also cannot comment on Clausen's acting in the context of his other roles - I personally found him quite believable - a touching monstrosity of a man, this Jorgen! As for the actor who played Kenneth - why would his participation in a TV show rule him out as an actor - aren't we over such elitist attitudes? International viewers unaware of his Big Brother participation will find him a fair actor.  In spite of the movie's faults (the writing could have been subtler in some instances), I do subscribe to what one could call the 'message' of the film - namely art's essential role in everyday life, art as healing force. Art, as Nietzsche said, sanctifies the lie ('Kunst heiligt die Luege') - it is a holy lie: the wedding scene is fabulous in this sense - a theatrical, not religious, wedding, celebrating love and life as play..."
2,"This is a really a beautiful and touching movie. Many others and I have given many praises to this movie. But its popularity and IMDB rating at 7.5 are quite a surprise to us.  As many of you can only watch it on DVD/VHS now, let me give you an info. I watched it the first time in the cinema and the following 5 or more times on DVD. When I watched it in the cinema, near the end of the movie when John Sullivan Sr reappeared, ALL THE AUDIENCES IN THE CINEMA cheered and applauded. I mean ALL THE AUDIENCES. Really, no kidding!!! It touched the entire crowd. Very emotional and uplifting. I have gone to cinemas for lots of movies, but rarely did I see any effect like this. Based on such audience response, who could doubt about how good this movie is?  Yes, its story line is not 100% logical. But if such measuring stick is applied to ALL MOVIES, I wonder which one can pass and be considered good!  Frequency, I highly recommend it, to be watched and to be owned!!!"
2,"Eternally entrancing firebrand actress Yvette Mimieux scores her best, strongest, most commanding and effective role to date as a smart, classy, fiercely self-sufficient no bulls**t Los Angeles businesswoman who runs afoul of psycho hicks and rapist redneck cops when she goes down South during her cross country trek from California to New York. Poor Yvette has one of those days which justifies the age-old cliché ""sometimes it's better to stay home in bed"": her car is stolen by a creepy backwoods hick nutjob (an intense, jittery Robert Carradine, who's genuinely frightening in a rare full-blooded sicko fruitcake part), she's wrongly put in the hoosegow by the local yokel cops after loutish bartender Britt Leach tries to sexually assault her, kills one particularly unpleasant hillbilly fuzzball after he brutally rapes her (the rape scene itself is quite graphic and upsetting), breaks out of jail and subsequently goes on the lam with tough, but tender-hearted career criminal Tommy Lee Jones.  ""Jackson County Jail"" qualifies as one of those great legendary rarities: it's a 70's redneck drive-in exploitation movie that not only delivers the goods and then some, but also the kind of gritty, top-notch, fairly plausible flick that both wholly earns and completely lives up to its killer cult status. Mark Miller's remarkably artful and assured direction plays a key role in making the film the grind-house classic that it is: the quick, unrelenting pace never let's up for a minute, the action scenes are rousing and marvelously choreographed, and the solid, pretty complicated and arresting narrative hooks the viewer from the get-go. Moreover, the film's astute depiction of the relative differences and similarities between cops and criminals is wickedly subversive: The crooks for the most part are loyal, honorable and compassionate folks while a majority of the police are total a**holes. This deliciously amoral masterstroke, a typically twisted piece of 70's B-movie nihilism which boldly bucks convention, lifts ""Jackson County Jail"" well above the rut of your standard-issue by-the-numbers formula drive-in fare.  However, that's not to say that ""Jackson County Jail"" fails to hit the bull's eye in other departments; it's an across-the-board winner in every conceivable way. The uniformly excellent cast alone testifies to this: Severn Darden as a prissy, kindly, quirky sheriff, Howard Hesseman as Yvette's faithless smarmy husband, Mary Woronov as a butch lesbian outlaw gal, ""Revenge of the Cheerleaders"" 's adorable lead bimbo Patrice Rohmer as Jones' jealous ex-girlfriend, Cliff Emmich as a loathsome male chauvinist CEO Yvette tells off at the start of the movie, and future ""Hill Street Blues"" TV series regular Betty Thomas as a saucy, outspoken greasy spoon waitress who tries to fleece Yvette out of ten bucks. Loren Newkirk's melancholy, harmonica-heavy, nicely down-home country score, the often razor-sharp dialogue (when Yvette tells Jones to be careful when he faces off with the pigs at the film's thrilling conclusion, Jones responds with this choice fatalistic retort: ""I was born dead anyway""), the unsparingly bleak and harsh downbeat nightmarish tone, and especially Bruce Logan's agile, polished cinematography (the use of hand-held camera for Jones' climactic face-off with the law really does the stirring trick) are all also highly impressive. Gripping, suspenseful and exciting in comparable measure, ""Jackson County Jail"" stands tall as a sterling example of 70's hayseed exploitation cinema at its tense, tantalizing zenith."
2,"The first time I saw this movie I thought it was entertaining. The second time I saw this movie I rolled laughing. The third time I saw this movie I thought it was the most ingenious comedy I had ever seen. Now, every time I watch this movie it just gets funnier and funnier. Many people think that it is lame or cheesy. The point of the movie is to be cheesy. It's a satire of early American life. As far as the historical relevance and the mentality of people in America at that point in time, it's astonishingly accurate. Matthew Perry's character is supposed to represent bureaucratical society, while Chris Farley embodies the lower class American ""pioneer."" In truth, it is a fantastic representation poking fun at the ""way things were."" Cheesy as it may be, it was intended- and lives up to its intentions with comedic splendor. A+"
2,"If seen now by young people who weren't old enough to have lived during the Viet-Nam War, this film will seem ""small"" and out-dated. But, when this film was released in 1969 at the peak of the war, this was not only a very funny film, but a sad reality of the society of the times.   Sad in the fact that some draft-age males would make believe they were gay to avoid going to Viet-Nam.  Made slightly before the Gay Liberation movement, this film gives a surprisingly sensitive view of the gay lifestyle and gay community of this era. Micheal Greer gives an academy award winning performance (he wasn't even nominated)as the gay landlord, Malcom DeJohn; in one of the screens funniest, yet sensitive performances. DeJohn is best remembered as ""Queenie"" in the brutal prison film, Fortune in Men's Eyes.   The stars of the show, Kevin Coughlin as Danny and Lawrence Casey as Elliot give fresh, intense, and emotional edged performances as men living with the fear of the war lurking over their shoulders.  Also wonderful supporting roles by Sebastian Brook and veteran character actor Jack Starrett.  The Gay Deceivers captures a time in American history that has been forgotten. Yet, today's headlines have made this film worthwhile today. The Gay Deceivers is not deceiving at all, I rate it a 10 out of 10."
2,"I first saw this film when I was but a young lad, and loved it - the fact that some of the film was set in Australia played something of a major part in this - although some bits frightened me for no apparent reason. On repeated viewings, however, I have to say the film still holds up in the manner it was intended: over the top, extremely silly, fun.  The casting is superb; Christopher Lee and Alan Arkin skine, and I'm one Australian who wouldn't have minded seeing Graham Kennedy as the real Prime Minister...  Although they're quite well written - the ""Hypno-Ray"" song still sticks in my memory - the songs do seem a bit out of place, but when you're watching the story of an alcoholic ex-superhero who's retired to Australia, well... Frankly I think the sillier the better!"
0,"Wow, this film was just bloody horrid. SO bad in fact that even though I didn't pay to see it, I still wanted my money back.  The film is about nothing intelligible. It's a mish-mash of sci-fi cliche's that were done better by much more skilled film makers. The performances, especially by the leads were over the top in a less endearing Ed Wood sort of way. Speaking of Ed Wood, he'd be proud of the character's dialogue. It's just too taciturn with no hint of irony or sense of humor. On top of that, it doesn't make sense, nor does the plot, or lackthereof.  The visual effects are okay, but not enough to go ""oh wow, that's cool"" and they just seem to be thrown in to ""be cool"" rather than be a good plot device.  The soundtrack was another mishmash of stuff that really never set any sort of mood. Again, it seemed as if the director was just throwing in songs in the film in an effort to ""be cool"".  Which brings me to my final point. Perhaps if the director actually worried more about plot, story and dialogue instead of trying to ""be cool"", he wouldn't have made such a dorky cliche' of a short film.  "
0,"OK, If you're looking for another Bastketball Diaries, this is completely the wrong film.  I revolves around two brothers. Max, the younger, has a major cocaine addiction. Adam, the eldest, is a doctor. This movie is suppose to show the plunge from reality to the extreme lows that drugs make possible. It however, does not. It shows that cocaine can be fun no matter what the situation happens to be present. Most of the movie focus is on Max and his parting ways. Eventually Adam, can no longer take the stress from his job and begins to use as well (perscription drugs).  This movie has almost no climax. Doesn't descend into what cocaine really does to you, has boring and low-budget scenes, and the acting of the eldest brother, Adam, is horrific.  I have no idea how this movie has managed to pass and receive awards, it is not a heart-wencher. If you want a clear and true story movie on the extreme world of drugs- rent, if not buy 'The Basketball Diaries'. And notice the difference.  Try to avoid this movie but, if you think you will enjoy. Try and see for yourself..."
1,"NB: Spoilers within. This great movie is ""about"" so many things, all of them successfully: sci-fi time travel, unstable psychologies, dystopian society, the what-is-real syndrome, gradual undermining of belief systems, worldwide bioterrorism, and a nascent love story.  The ramifications of the story's twisted time line stir up loads of heated debate - witness the discussions within this site; or, as an extreme, check out the dissertation at www.mjyoung.net/time/monkeys.html. Whew! Such temporal emphasis speaks mostly to the brilliant plot, coming from the magnificent work of writers David and Janet Peoples, not to mention the inspiration of Chris Marker's ""La Jetee."" Without a doubt, this is one of the most successful, fascinating time-travel movies ever conceived. But there are many other levels speaking here.  The movie's real genius is to focus on the nasty side effects of time-travel in the mind of James Cole (Bruce Willis, doing the best work of his career here). His journey progresses from gung-ho vaccine-hunting warrior to gradually unhinged victim  and back again. The other broad sweep of the story increasingly emphasizes the personal tale between James and Dr. Kathryn Railly (the wonderful Madeleine Stowe). I love the simultaneous shifting/opposing viewpoints of these two characters. For me it all comes to a head in the fleabag hotel room scene. By this point, James  once gripped by an unshakable determination  now slumps in utter doubt about his own reality; while Dr. Railly  the cool and rational scientist  has finally become wildly convinced, after absorbing James's proofs, of his horrific predictions. Her desperation to get through to James and hang on to the mission shows how far she's come.  Gilliam makes us care about these characters, especially through the crescendo of tension threading their lives. The balance held between emotional roller-coaster and mounting sci-fi puzzle/thriller is exquisite. And the denouement at the airport is heart-poundingly intense because we see it coming so clearly through James's dreams. It is here, just after James has decided to quit the whole mess  and is fighting his insanity more than ever  that he steps back up to the plate and does what is necessary for mankind. See Jose and the gun (Just before this, the references to Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" and identity switching/confusion are brilliant.) This is a movie to be hashed out between thinking people; it not only holds up under repeated viewings, it demands them. ""Twelve Monkeys"" is intelligent, provocative, bizarre, funny, and suspenseful stuff.  The supporting cast is excellent, especially Brad Pitt stealing all of his scenes and showing great flexibility as Jeffery Goines, crazed and spoiled, but ever the survivor. And there is David Morse as Dr. Peters (interesting how the movie simply leaves to the viewer his wicked motivation) and Christopher Plummer as Dr. Goines. But the biggest accolades belong to Terry Gilliam, surpassing here - just barely - his outstanding ""Brazil."" (Lots of parallels, of course, especially the lonely combatant trying to escape his crumbling surroundings: lunacy within, lunacy without.) Every frame of this movie has his unique stamp and tone. The soundtrack is terrific, too.  This is one of the great achievements of the 90s, a true favorite of mine, and sure to hold up for a long time to come."
2,"...absolutely, bar none.  At best corny and clichéd, at worst insulting to my intelligence.  For example; when the baddie throws a passenger out of a 747 door whilst flying above the airport, on a stormy night, just to prove a point, the body just happens to fall through the glass roof of the control tower where the team are negotiating with the hijacker. 'nuff said.  I feel sorry for the original audiences that will never regain those wasted couple of hours and bemused by anyone who would actually go out and spend money on the DVD. I see in the voting that some people actually gave this a 10? Presumably the director, crew and assorted family."
1,"A brilliant portrait of a traitor (Victor McLaglen in Oscar winning performance) who is hounded by his own conscience. McLaglen plays an IRA rouge who betrays his leader to collect a reward during Ireland's Sinn Fein Rebellion. The scenes showing fights and mob actions are very realistic, focusing on the desperation within individuals. The lack of hope for a better future seems to be a fate worse than death.  Director John Ford superbly creates an murky and tense atmosphere, enhanced by the foggy and grimy depiction of the Irish landscape. Max Steiner's dramatic music score adds to the cinematic delight. Oscar Winner also for Best Screenplay, nominated for Best Picture. This is one of Hollywood's Classic."
1,"Gojoe is part of a new wave of Japanese cinema, taking very creative directors, editors and photographers and working on historic themes, what the Japanese call ""period pieces"". Gojoe is extremely creative in terms of color, photography, and editing. Brilliant, even. The new wave of Japanese samurai films allows a peek at traditional beliefs in shamanism, demons and occult powers that were certainly a part of their ancient culture, but not really explored in Kurosawa's samurai epics, or the Zaitochi series. Another fine example of this genre is Onmyoji (2001). I would place director Sogo Ichii as one of the most interesting and creative of the new wave Japanese directors. Other recent Japanese period pieces I would highly recommend include Yomada's Twilight Samurai (2002) and Shintaro Katsu's Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman (2003)."
2,"For a low budget movie, it was quite well done. Outstanding performance by Craig Peck as Mike; who's an avid horror movie goer and had all the best lines in this film. Worth watching for him who seems to be the only smart one in the film"
2,"Steve Buscemi is one of the greatest actors of all time, in my opinion, for the simple fact that he makes all of his characters memorable.  This film is an accurate look at life for the guys who never really made the cut and were left behind in a world full of unused degrees and previous money.  The film is depressing, and therefore I'd recommend everyone watch it, especially those who were born into their own perfect little worlds and became what they are because of their parents' money. This one is for the tools of society that don't think that these people exist or think that they are merely peons. Get a clue; this was once the working population of the country."
1,"I wanted to see Sarah Buffy on the big screen, so I first bought tickets and then checked the reviews at IMDb. I worried about seeing a bad movie. Well, I had fun watching the movie. Some parts, which obviously were meant to be scary, were actually quite humoristic, almost as in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  I don't consider this a bad movie. It's not a great movie either. Just a rather well made horror movie. It does not rely heavily on special effects, but on camera angles, acting, music. In my opinion, the acting was OK. Sarah did a very good job, quite convincing. The other actors were definitely not bad either, I liked Yoko.  The sets are nice (and I don't care that the sets are the exact same ones that were used in the Japanese original).  The scary moments were often predictable. But not always. I have seen quite some horror, and did not expect to be scared now, but it happened at least twice. Nice.  The movie had some nice scenes that were almost original, like the trails of rubbish, the simple special effects for he ghosts, the eyes of the boy, the cat that made eery noises, the gurgling of the dead boy and his mother.  Don't go if you want to see Sarah in another Buffy episode, because it is very different from her Buffy work, much more serious. Don't go if you only want to see movies that gather Oscar nominations. It's a good horror movie, enough suspense. I gave it a 7."
2,"Widowed father Jack Tanaka (Don 'the Dragon' Wilson) feels that his son Brad is drifting from him. After catching his son drinking one sip of beer at a party, he grounds him for a week. The grandfather makes a custom virtual reality game in hopes of bringing the father and son closer together again. But when Brad get stuck in the game Jack has to follow him in and save him. No, it's not a exceptionally good film, but what the hell were you thinking when you rented a film starring The Dragon? Hamlet? I didn't think so. If you like Don, you probably will like this one , all others steer clear.  My Grade: D+ (would be higher if it didn't have the Monkeyman in it)"
1,"Lily Mars, a smalltown girl living in Indiana, dreams of making it big on Broadway and her aspirations are given a lift when successful Broadway producer John Thornway returns to his hometown for a visit. Lily tries everything she can to get Thornway to notice her, but he just gets annoyed with her antics. When Thornway goes back to New York to stage his show, Lily follows (unknown to John of course) and Thornway eventually gives her a small role in his next show, only as a favor to her family, however Thornway starts to fall for this young girl and a romance blossoms, which makes the show's leading lady, Isabel Rekay, jealous. When Isabel gets fed up with the John-Lily romance causing friction with the show, she leaves, and John decides to make Lily the star. Isabel returns later, and Thornway is forced to tell Lily that she is back to her small bit role in the play, which also may jeopardize the romance. Very charming film, and a refreshing change to see Garland put the comedic touches into her role (her reading of Lady MacBeth, while supposed to be humorous, never threatened her singing career) I enjoyed Heflin's character (Thornway) more when he was annoyed with Lily rather than be the romantic. The film got to be somewhat predictable and the scenes weren't assembled that well together, but a very enjoyable film. Rating, 7."
2,"When you pop either THE GREEN PASTURES or HALLELUJAH in your DVD player, Warner Brothers' disclaimer comes up, stating these films ""are a product of their time.... it does not express Warner Brothers' opinion....."" Okay, they're setting the record straight. They want to present two excellent movies, without offending anyone. The ""warning"" is eclipsed by two factors. These two films, both with all black casts, showcase amazing talent often smothered by the then Hollywood studio system. They also both carry a message of faith told in a very entertaining manner.   THE GREEN PASTURES opens with a Sunday School sermon in the deep south. The classroom is made up of attentive black children asking some pretty intelligent questions about the Bible. We peek into one child's view of heaven. Since this child probably knows very little of the world outside her community, heaven is one big fish-fry with plenty to eat, where the adults get to hangout and smoke ten-cent ""see-gars"".   It's here where God (referred to in the film as ""De Lawd"") makes an appearance. This is an Oscar worthy performance by Rex Ingram, one of many black actors at the time who seldom received decent film work from Hollywood. Ingram plays ""De Lawd"" in a sweet, soft-spoken manner, never talking down to the humans he created. ""Now you're just doing fine,"" he tells Adam. ""But there's just one thing missing. You need a family."" Ingram's quiet tone always tells us this guy has things in order. Film fans may remember Rex Ingram as Jim in HUCKLEBERRY FINN (1939) and as the laughing, constantly sarcastic genie in THE THIEF OF BAGDAD (1940). Not only was Ingram an accomplished stage actor, but he was a certified MD as well!   Ingram also plays Adam and Hezdrel. During the later performance, GREEN PASTURES most memorable time-tested message comes across very simply. We realize this is truly a cinematic classic. The Bible stories are depicted here in pseudo 20th century settings with old world behavior. (Much like the villages in the first three FRANKENSTEIN films) Moses is a modern-day ""trickster"" who gives Pharaoh's top magician a run for his money. In another scene, a pistol packing gangster in a double breasted suit mouths off to Noah."
2,"First of all this movie was made for television. Plot-wise it has a cheap movie of the week feel. The acting isn't bad. In fact the leads are all quite good and in some cases stellar. Any weaknesses in performances have more to do with really bad makeup. The ageing is horribly done and not very convincing.  At one point ""Rock"" says, ""some poor woman is missing her makeup kit"" and it led me to wonder if the ""poor woman"" was in fact the film's makeup director. Dreadful stuff.  A few others have commented on the accuracy of the characterizations -- I believe they're alluding to whether Rock Hudson gave Mark Christian AIDS without telling him he had it -- perhaps the most damning (and criminal) thing in the film. I'm not sure anyone knows other than the principles. George Nader is missing from the entire film.  There are some serious gaps in this film. Massive gaps actually. The film presents the picture that Hudson's career was over by the mid 1960s and he retired from acting. Nothing could be further from the truth. The film omits the SEVEN seasons Rock Hudson played the lead in McMillan & Wife -- the popular detective series of the 1970s. For many of us it was our first introduction to Hudson.  The other gap is the unbelievable prudishness in presenting Hudson's relationships. No kisses and very little tenderness. It is deceptive and a lie to present his relationships this way.  There's a better film out there demanding to be made."
1,"Fay, the sister of the notorious Nobel prize-winning smut poet Simon Grim, still loves Henry Fool. Their son receives an ingenious orgy-in-a-box from an undisclosed sender and a chase across three continents ensues, involving a supremely sad-sack collection of government agents, terrorists, flight attendants, and bellhops.  Parker Posey delivers a perfectly timed comic performance, including some brilliant physical work. With strong contributions by Jasmin Tabatabai and Saffron Burrows, Fay Grim proves in the best Billy Wilder tradition that nothing is funnier than a beautiful woman in trouble.  Another good score by Hartley (and thanks in the credits to the American Academy in Berlin, where Hartley served as a fellow in Fall 2004)."
0,"'Succubus', the edited version of 'Necronomicon Geträumte Sünden', is a struggle to sit through, even at a lean 76 minutes; any more of this dreadfully boring and pretentious Euro horror tripe and I may have slipped into a coma.  Jess Franco once again delivers a truly awful piece of 60s trash that appears to have been made by a cast and crew out of of their heads on Class A hallucinogenics, since not one second of this mess made any sense whatsoever. Apparently, this is one of the better of his 180+ films  it's hard to believe that there are worse efforts out there.  The unfathomable plot deals with Franco's usual themes of sex, violence and lesbianism and throws in a bit of S&M for good measure, and yet it still manages to remain mind numbingly tedious.  I may leave it quite a while before entering the world of dodgy Euro Horror again  life is too short to be spent watching bilge like this."
2,"All I can say about this game is wow. Sega does it again (very hard for them to keep it up though). I loved the gameplay, soundtrack, and story line. I still play it since there's so much to do (get every emblem, get perfect scores, etc). I also thought it was very well-planned and made. Good job Sega. Hopefully they'll keep it up, even as a second party."
0,"This has to be the cheapest film made in 21st century. It is all the way low quality, but at the end it falls below... everything. All the cheap tricks - like flashing and darkness - are used to hide those crappy computer effects.  All the actors are below average, especially the main character Anne Fletcher (Simmone Mackinnon). There is a scene, where Anne is asked: ""Why you seem so careless?"" The correct answer is, because she can't act. No matter what happens (the world is about to be destroyed, her friend is dying, she is fired), she has the same stupid grin in her face.  It is not only the movie, which is B -quality. It is also the back cover description (at least in Finland). The text mentions things like Lorica Gray -vessel, Capital -vessel and main character Garrison Harper and Anna (not Anne) Fletcher. The description sounds like a different movie, both featuring character called Fletcher and sea monsters"
2,"I saw it yesterday at a local movie theater. As a turk, I think it is a depiction of anti-americanism run amok in turkey. The main reason behind this attitude is the thought that if we don't stand in solidarity with our neighbor (Saddam's Iraq) we would be the next to be hit. In addition to this came the economical damage caused by 1991 gulf war and America's prospects of establishing a kurdish state in the oil rich areas of Iraq where also many turcomen are deported from their villages. These prospects are explained in detail in the movie.  In reflecting the personalities of people from a different culture, this movie is very much like ""midnight express"". In midnight express each and every one of the turks in the movie was a sadistic villain. Likewise, Kurtlar Vadisi depicts all of the Americans as plain villains. Additionaly, the sight of American soldiers driving a Mercedes army truck from 60's is just hilarious. Also my personal belief is that the organ trading cannot be done officially, as is depicted in the movie. With Gary Busey and Billy Zane starring it is easy to see that it could only be a B-movie.  I hate this movie as much as I hate midnight express because it does not serve a useful purpose except for making it harder for different cultures to know each other and get along.  Some quotes from the movie: Doctor: You just can't treat those prisoners like that. They are people, not animals. Sam's assistant: I have more respect for animals than I have for those iraqis, sir."
0,"Having been forced by my children to watch this at least 10 times for each of the last 2 Christmases, I feel adequately qualified to pass judgment on this version of Dr. Seuss' classic tale, and well... it's not very good. First off, following a classic act like Chuck Jones' animated TV special is going to be difficult for anyone, but this interpretation is so heavy-handed and padded as to be positively numbing. I will concede that there are a handful of inspired gags, but overall the film comes off as a calculated cash grab, at the same time as it is supposedly decrying the commercialisation of Christmas. Jim Carrey is typically over the top here, but that is completely at odds with the character of the Grinch. As characterised by Boris Karloff, he was a slow burn; methodical and sly. There is no method to Carrey's madness, and that is only the most obvious error made. Talented actors like Jeffrey Tambor and Christine Baranski are utterly wasted here. Why, Universal, why? I mean , I understand that Tony Hopkins will take just about any role offered (much like his countryman Michael Caine), but this one needs to be filed under ""Films that should never have been made."" This does not bode well for the Cat in the Hat, an even thinner tome that Universal is prepping for this Christmas. I get the feeling that I will be making the same recommendation for that one as I am with this one: skip it, and either read the book or watch the TV special. This is 2 hours you can never, ever get back."
1,"Magnificent and unforgettable, stunningly atmospheric, and brilliantly acted by all.  I really cannot understand what sort of people are panning this masterpiece and giving the preponderance of votes as 8 (and nine ones!)  This, along with Grapes of Wrath, is John Ford's greatest movie. I would say that Long Voyage Home is next in line, though quite a way back.  Rating: 10. It deserves a 12."
2,"given this is a short, the viewer is fooled by grasping a lot in a small amount of time. this was made possible by a superb cast and talented writing. since ""fine lines"" between anything in life prove to always be a more complex and deeper matter that what is seen at the surface, it is truly a feat that this film gives the viewer a chance to see both sides of a very entertaining situation. in the dating game, perceptions of cute and creepy are in the eye of the beholder--and in this case, the eyes and minds of the viewers of the film as they are allowed to draw their own conclusions and create their own definitions of two seemingly different words in our vernacular. i enjoyed this film for its blurring of lines and boundaries and for making me redefine my own perceptions, it only for a short amount of time."
2,"I had never heard of this movie, but boy was I disappointed in it. The plot really didn't make sense, and the actors weren't really given enough decent material to work with. Actors like Michael Lerner (who I loved in Barton Fink) and Paul Giamatti (take your pick; he's a great character actor) were wasted in this seemingly pointless exercise in filmmaking. I think the humor was supposed to stem from the odd ""situation"" of two ordinary guys cracking safes, but it didn't ring true. Good or great comedy is supposed to make you forget that the situations are implausible or impossible, but ""Safe Men"" just reminded you the whole time that this could never really happened. It wasn't one of those absolutely painful films that makes you groan, but it is the kind of movie I just couldn't wait to see end. ""Meet the Parents"", John Hamburg's second effort as a writer is much funnier and much better, so don't count him out as a comedic force in the future, but BLEECH!"
2,"Rap hip hop cool western, yo! A gang of black cowboy gangstas are planning the biggest heist of their lives. A fortune is passing through a small bank in a godforsaken town ruled by a sinister tyrant and his sadistic son. The paths of the gang and the tyrant passed before, and sweet revenge or brutal death is imminent as they meet again.  Now, this actually sounds quite intriguing to me, but there is one huge problem: The movie actually takes itself dead serious, while it on the best is a big joke.  OK, I can try to ignore the girls in the movie has silicon enlarged lips, with a tattoo outliner and a nice lip gloss thrown in, looking like some random prostitutes dragged off the street, with much less acting skills than you would expect even from a female of that given profession.  I can also try to ignore the desperate attempts at trying to be new by putting every known western cliché upside down, like the women are the strong ones kicking the guys butt, the black people are the cool dudes from da hood untouched by the slavery common a the time, while the white guys at best are stupid and pathetic cannon fodder, or at best evil and rotten to the bone.  I bet the director would be sued for racism if he movie had all the black guys exchanged with white guys. Not that I care about the political correctness of a movie, if the movie is good anything flies.  But, what kind of mindless, drug abused mind have come up with the plot?? I mean, some guys come up with the brilliant plan of walking straight into a bank loaded with treasure yet with no guards whatsoever, flash a gun, take the money before some guy chasing them magically appears outside from nowhere and we have a final shootout.  THATS IT! Swallow it down with some oh so deep soulshattering philosophy about bonds between brothers are stronger than life and death, made into a joke by what is possibly the worst western movie ever made.  I thought it would be refreshing and new, but they killed everything good about western movies, and added a bunch of boring, cliché-filled, badly executed elements instead.  I will even go so far to say that I can in fact enjoy a good turkey, because it becomes so bad it is actually fun to watch in good company, but this.. This is not even that.  Don't SEE THIS MOVIE! IT IS A TOTAL AND UTTERLY WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY! If you need to see an alternative Western movie, see Wild Wild West with Will Smith again instead, it is mindblowingly better than this load of humus."
2,"I saw this movie at a film festival when it first came out and, after skipping over it at the local library for the last nine months, finally borrowed it on loan to see what my younger roommate would think of it and to view it again myself, nearly a decade later. It certainly features game performance by the three male leads, but the real triangle here is that of the gay male hunk, the plus size, clueless fag hag and nebbish gay guy.   Unfortunately, what a number of viewers apparently found funny in Mara Hobel's character of Christina, I simply found mostly tiresome and repetitive. From her scene walking in to the divey apartment ""Fabulous"" to her scene walking in to roommate Marc's bedroom after he first has sex to her nervous breakdown or crying during the ""grand gesture"" to the whole cluelessness of her New York existence - it just was about four feet too much over the top and ruined what little good there was in her character or her performance. What was her degree in? Basket Weaving? She took that special class for the championship NYU football team in Ballroom Dancing? In 1997, she graduated from college without knowing how to find a semi colon on a key board?  But so as to not seem like I am aiming all my daggers at Ms. Hobel, the idea that the ""bad"" good would turn out to be (a) a liar; (b) a user; or (c) a hustler were not only predictable but telegraphed not just a mile away, but a drive through the state of Texas away. Likewise, that the nerdy nebbish (Woody Allen without the fixation on the adopted children of his mate) gay guy -- who, unfortunately for him, was ten years ahead of the gay geek hotness era we find ourselves in -- and in any event, hot gay geeks are not Broadway musical fans much less piano players, would be in love (in classic Hollywood romantic comedies from the 40s and 50s fashion) with the gay hunk best pal and, ultimately, the hunk would (for no reason at all, without any real basis, after turning him down because the neb was clearly not the hunk's type, and after lusting in love with a guy who's only real thing in common with the neb is that they both have a musical background? You might as well say that the hunk fell in love with them because they both breath air.  This film does have some charms and again, with a different writer and director, some different casting choices, a tighter script (it went on too long, meaning some entire characters could have been cut out), might have made more of itself. You could cut the entire Cynthia story down to 5 minutes and not make her a roommate and make Marc's apartment a studio and have a much tighter and probably more interesting movie in the process. Perhaps then you could spend a little more time in the relationship between Robert and Marc to justify why they end up together at the end, other than rom com conventions of the Hollywood 40s and 50s and bad Broadway musicals of every era, say they must."
2,"i paid 4.95 to rent this movie. after the first five minutes i considered throwing it into the fire and paying the fine just so nobody else would ever have to go through what i just did.  for a start, it's meant to feature teenagers, not a bunch of plain, emotionless mid-twenties huffing and puffing their way past some trees. The camera work is not impressive. the scenery is dull.  hide and seek. i'm sorry but tell me who among you of this age has a bunch of friends who all go out and play hide and seek together? just coz they run fast doesn't mean it's a hardcore game. it's hide and seek. it's the hardcore version of peek-a-boo. it doesn't get any higher than that.  i did watch this to the end, while i was watching another movie at the same time on my laptop. i looked up every time somebody spoke. which was what like about three times. other times i accidentally looked up i saw running.  I could write a lot more on how unbelievably horrible this 'movie' was. but i won't. some people like to watch running. if you enjoy ugly people, running, and trees, then you've found your cult classic. I will say though, movies like these are terribly necessary because without them we'd never appreciate good films.  My advice: get every single copy you see, snap the disc in half then put it in a box. then put that box inside another box. then post it to yourself. and when it arrives, smash it with a hammer."
2,"After enjoying The Plumber by Peter Weir,i hoped that this would be as good (or better) then that movie,sadly it came nowhere near being that. The plot:  In Paris (Australia),a man who had a while a go,accidentally run-down an old man,car breaks down in a small town.While there,the memories of his brother (who has died in a crash)come back.The man finds out,while staying in a local hospital that the towns people use the crashed cars in a strange ways... View on the film:  While there are some interesting set-pieces (the derby-style crash,the psychiatrist identifying items scene).The rest of the film feels painfully slow,with the third-act feeling a bit rushed.Weir does a very good job with some of the small set-pieces,but makes the rest of the film to slow. Final view on the film: Good to see if nothing else is on,or if you want to see Weires films,by film-to-film."
1,"This movie is about development. People growing and people fading, people surprising and people disappointing. It has it all and more. There is hope, frustration, injustice, justice, love and hate. It is truly a classic drama that has fantastic performances from the whole cast but especially Whoopi Goldberg in her debut role.  This movie made me feel very human and proud of it, and I suggest that this movie should be mandatory each Saturday in all prisons in the world - it touches your compassion. Rating: 10 of 10.  PS: I admit it: I shed a tear of joy during the final scene."

1,"If the redundancy of getting off the boat, on the boat, off the bus, on the bus.. is a way to waste time then you should go back to the Hollywood films that wrap this part up in one montage in order to get to the money shots. and in doing so leave you unconnected and in the cinematic limbo that results from not really showing the realities of life. The long drawn out travel sequences actually allow the viewer the same frustration and 'wait- in-line' feeling the characters must endure. Frustrating? yes. Vital? Indeed. the limbo of that travel is the key to the 'rootlessness' of this Turkish family. Beautiful film with great acting. Sad, but worth it."
2,"Where to begin? First off, most of the film is flashbacks. Second, the beginning was stupid, and third, a lot of boring dialog and bad actors. The monster is quite disturbing and so is his roar. They had small parts like when a woman is shown for 2 minutes and is killed. There was parts when i felt like turning it off but I had nothing else to do. After the credits end, there is a minute of the screen pitch black and the music still going. I bet it was to make the movie a minute longer. I gave it a 3, because I like b-horror films,i like Frankenstein movies and you have to give Leigh some credit. My recommendation: if you see it at the video store, tell a person working there that it is a waste of money for you to rent that. So stay away as far as possible. Don't say I didn't warn you."
2,"Christie did all sorts of things with mystery, but in this case she stuck to the genre as genre. In this case, the idea is to deepen the groove, to follow the pattern and surprise with small things rather than the grand upsets of other stories.  In that case, the subtleties are important: the richnesses of character aren't there to define a person, instead to indicate a world, many worlds as candidates for the one world that is true.  These BBC do more than just tinker with the story, they flatten those worlds into characters, and then strut these characters as stereotypes. All the richness of the mystery is lost.  In this case, there's an extra cause for humor: to enhance the local flavor and also satisfy modern correctness, we have extended additions involving the local people: an aunt and a patronizing voodoo bit.  The result is an unwatchable mess.  Since nothing of value can be said of this particular episode, this is a good a place as any to remark on the portrayal of Miss Marple. In the books, the character is a busybody, slightly obnoxious, fussy. Bright, but only by measurements in her own world. She is as occupied with her garden as the gossip in the village. She is, in fact, as comical in her own way as Poirot is meant to be.  The BBC characterizations make Poirot more comical and Marple decidedly less so. She is reduced to one mannerism, an ""oh dear oh dear oh dear"" or some slight variation, while at the same time hovering near fondly remembered grandmotherisms. The whole  fulcrum of the craft is in the position of the detective, where they are in comparison to us. Here that fulcrum has been blindly moved to a sunnier spot.  A real shame.  Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."
2,"Although not a very well made movie (the writing and editing are especially weak) the late Raul Julia's performance is stunning, as are the performances of many of his supporting cast. The journey his character (and presumably the actual archbishop Romero) makes from innocence to awareness is deeply moving and very convincing. His story is remarkable and well worth forgiving the director and editor for not realizing it's full potential. The impact is in Julia's performance and you'll be with him from the moment he fills the screen. Probably one of Raul Julia's most remarkable performances. Another performance worth note is that of the late Richard Jordan who, as Father Grande, helps lead the archbishop to an awareness of the suffering of his people."
2,"What a genius! Fellini went and broke the cardinal rule of screenwriting. In the end, the character woke from a dream. The whole stinking movie was a dream. The first time around, it's one of the most confusing, annoying things ever, but it makes perfect sense the second time around.  Beautiful."
1,"Beautiful film, pure Cassavetes style. Gena Rowland gives a stunning performance of a declining actress, dealing with success, aging, loneliness...and alcoholism. She tries to escape her own subconscious ghosts, embodied by the death spectre of a young girl. Acceptance of oneself, of human condition, though its overall difficulties, is the real purpose of the film. The parallel between the theatrical sequences and the film itself are puzzling: it's like if the stage became a way out for the Heroin. If all american movies could only be that top-quality, dealing with human relations on an adult level, not trying to infantilize and standardize feelings... One of the best dramas ever. 10/10."
1,"Hopefully the score has changed by now due to my brilliant and stunning review which persuades all of you to go and watch the film thereby creating an instant chorus of ""8""s, this movie's true score.  As mentioned before Chris Rock is The King! Previous to going to see this movie I wasn't that over the top about him but now I'm banging on the doors of Chris Rock's website begging him to take me on as his protege. This film is truly funny, if you don't find this movie funny you REALLY need therapy and it's humour which targets all areas of society including race(predictably), class division, love, wealth, employment, dreams, stand up comedy... the list goes on.  There was one slight disappointment for me however. This was that in going into this film I didn't realise that it was actually a remake of ""Heaven Can Wait"" another quite good movie made in 1971 with Warren Beatty. As such I was quite surprised when I watched this movie and suddenly the plot began to unravel to be distinctly similar to an older movie I had watched on TV a few weeks ago.. Regardless this movie is in my opinion the better version out of the two of them simply because of the different areas it covers and the fact that Chris Rock is funnier than Warren Beatty any second of any day of any week of any year of any...you get the picture.  Well to the actual plot of the film.  Don't spoil the experience for yourself! Don't read the plot! Just go and watch a movie because there have been two reviews on IMDb so far that have raved mad about it, go see it because it is the funniest thing you would have seen in a long time, go and see it because it's a cinema experience that doesn't leave you grumbling ad nauseum at the cost of cinema tickets. Go see it because it is a good movie!"
2,"The short side of the story is that this has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Rythme-wise, the movie is dead. It makes you feel like you are attending a lecture on economy at the university. And to think that I watched the movie because it was described as a ""thriller!""  The story portrays an Arab plot to shake the foundations of global economy using the simple concept that there is alot more ""printed"" paper money than there is actual value out there in the world.  First of all, the movie is offensive to Arabs. If this movie was made now, civil rights groups and Muslim/Arab groups would be all over it, in one scene, Jane Fonda says (about taking a loan from those Arabs): ""I feel like a beggar asking them for money, and I HATE it!"" and Kristofferson comforts her by saying: ""You and the rest of the world!"" This is an out right racist statement that wouldn't slip so casually as it did in 1981. Aside from that, the movie protrays Arab customs rather poorly, on one side, the director of the movie is keen on showing Arab rich people sitting on the ground and eating with their hands from one big plate (to somehoe portray primitivity) and forcing Fonda and Kristofferson to do the same (which doesn't happen in real life, they give guests plates and spoons if they need them), but the director makes a bigger slip of showing them shaking hands with Fonda and sitting right next to her in the dinner. That would not take place in the same societies that eat with their hands from the plates.  Other omissions are plenty as well, portraying Arab countries and cities as vast areas of desert lands and tents doesn't portray what the Arab world looked like in 1981.  From an acting stand point, Fonda is not too bad, but Kristofferson is awful. His ""cowboy"" acting style really misses the target in this one. The image of a banker who talks like a cowboy, behaves like a cowboy and tells his boss in the bank that if he doesn't hang up the phone he would smash his head.. This image is just not real. The way every night fall in the movie almost always ends with Fonda and Kristofferson making love is also not real for two people well over fourty as the movie portrays. So, you feel like the roles were written in a naive way. Not much attention was put into seeing how the characters fit into their perspective roles.  Overall, this movie is not worth renting on video even, I would suggest waiting till its out there on TNT or TBS or something, in fact, it's not worth such a long review. (:-)))"
2,"Don't bother comparing this version of an old play with others. This one has Jeanette MacDonald and Brian Aherne and is splendid all on its own. A Word War II era look at the past it resonates with a thousand charming moments. She is lovely and even Gene Raymond charms. I think the special mood of this film may be that all of these faces are gone now and yet with us, part of those of us who watch and feel that vibration of the past lovers, the war in background and the sadness of our loss of that time and those faces, voices, memories. For me a pleasure enhanced with every viewing. A special thank your to Mr. Aherne who will always be a favorite of mine and hopefully others who have watches that expressive and quite beautiful but very masculine face. Definitely recommended."
2,"Boring.  If you are going to treat us to nothing but two actors for 85 minutes, at least have a decent script. The acting is good, but the actors can's salvage the script.  This movie seems to be a little like fusion jazz or extreme prog rock: made by musicians for musicians - anybody who isn't a proficient player (and appreciates great technical skill) will find it boring instead of marveling at the odd time signatures and fast scale runs. My brother (who is a movie maker himself, his short films have been featured in film festivals in Cuba, L.A., France, Russia, etc) and his movie-industry related friends liked it, nice photography, editing, etc.  But for ""plain old me who doesn't make movies"", the script is boring, and the ""plot twists"" are so far-fetched that I simply couldn't maintain the suspension of disbelief. **SPOILERS** ""Boohoo, I killed my little brother""?! A big stack of unsent wedding invitations a week before the wedding?!? Give me a break! A beautifully-shot dancing sequence... that doesn't do squat for the story, character development, hello? Maybe it was inserted for giving the film a bit of energy?  My opinion: A waste of money. (And my wife went as far as declaring it ""Worst Movie Ever"" ;)"
1,"One of the most definitive gangster films of the 80's, Scarface is very much a film of its time. The first thing you notice when you watch this film is that it is screaming at you, 'made in 1983'. The costumes, the music score and soundtrack, the hairstyles, make no mistake about it this is a film all about crime in the 80's and while it should have dated horribly it hasn't. This is still a superb film. While Georgio Moroder's music has dated a fair bit, it still compliments the story of Tony Montana well thanks to the superb screenplay by Oliver Stone and the first class direction of Brian De Palma, one of two films that he has made with Pacino (the other being the fantastic Carlito's Way). All of De Palma's trademarks are here; the strong language, the graphic violence (more on that later), the stylish excesses such as grandiose set pieces and of course the stylish camera work.  Pacino dominates the film and I mean that literally. He is the dominant star of this film. His performance over the top, this is one of those films were Pacino doesn't so much say his lines as he does shouts them, this time with a superb Cuban accent. However, this is Pacino and he does it fantastically. Only he could go this far over the top and still come away from the film with his acting integrity in tact. While some may complain about his shouting of his lines and the sheer excess of it all, this is an excessive film. Take a look at the production design of Tony's house, take a look at the violence in this film. The chainsaw incident is downright brutal and their is blood everywhere. The shoot out at the end has bodies going down at a rate that is more akin to Schwarzenegger and Stallone in the Rambo films. Take a look at the amount of coke that is displayed in the film so Pacino's performance I suppose is perfect for the film. He is supported by actors who are more akin to saying their lines in a more controlled way. Steven Bauer, in particularly, as Manny, Tony's best friend, is the stand out of the supporting cast. His performance is so controlled and quiet in a De Niro sort of way it is a wonder how he ended up doing straight to video soft porn. Michelle Pfeiffer, of course, adds the glamor, Robert Loggia adds gravitas as usual and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio makes a great debut as Tony's sister.  Of course this is more than just a film about excess. There is more to it than drugs, violence, chainsaw assaults and a big great shoot out. This is a film about the darker side of the American dream. In many ways it puts it on a thematic par with The Godfather films. Tony finds himself coming to America, getting it all, living the American dream and then losing it all in violent fashion, and by saying he loses it all, I mean he loses it all. He kills his best friend, his sister is killed, his empire crumbles, literally, around him and to top it of he is killed in his own mansion, bullets ripping through him.   Without doubt Scarface is one of the key films of the early 80's. Sure, it doesn't have the subtleties of The Godfather films, but this is still a fine film and one that is worth going to again and again."
1,"Three girls, the youngest descendents of the Gaylord family, one of America's most royal families, are orphaned at a young age. Right before he goes off to France to fight in WWI, their father tells the oldest, Fiona, never to sell the land. By the time the sisters have become adults, they have had to squander most of their money to pay for lawyers to defend their property. Through certain loopholes in the father's will, a man named Charles Barclay stands to gain possession of the Gaylord land, on which he wants to build a complex called Barclay Circle. Barclay is actually based on John D. Rockefeller, who was buying up land and buildings from affluent families in New York so he could build Rockefeller Center.  This film deals mostly with the melodramatic concerns of the three sisters. Fiona, well played by Barbara Stanwyck, although it's certainly not to be counted as one of her best roles, seems like a cold, domineering woman, and it becomes clear that she has some skeletons in her closet. Susanna, played by Nancy Coleman, is a little ditsy and completely in love with a young modern artist named Gig Young. Coleman's was my favorite performance in the film. Evelyn, played by Geraldine Fitzgerald, is a rather pretentious seductress with a monocle who married into noble blood in England, but that doesn't stop her from trying to steal Gig from her sister. The three sisters are developed quite well but, as is the major trend in The Gay Sisters, never well enough. Charles Barclay is played by George Brent. He isn't very good. Well, he would be satisfactory if the story had played out the way it should have, but he always seems like a scumbag in the film. When we're asked to sympathize with him late in the film, it's impossible. Gig Young is played by, huh?, Gig Young. No, he's not playing himself. What happened is that the actor, who had acted in several movies previously under his real name, Byron Barr, was pressured by Warner Brothers to change his name to something more catchy. I'm not sure who made the final choice, but he eventually changed his screen name to Gig Young, after the character whom he plays in The Gay Sisters. Weird, eh? Young is quite good through most of the film, but the script does some unfortunate things with his character late in the film which ultimately harm the audience's sympathy for him. In two other supporting roles, Helen Thimig and Gene Lockhart are quite good.  The Gay Sisters had great potential to turn out to be one of the great cinematic family sagas. The characters are all interesting, as are their situations. Unfortunately, the script never strives for anything more than the simplest melodrama. If it had made the interrelationships of all the major characters more complex, fleshed out, for example, the rivalry between Evelyn and Susanna or made the flashback more intricate, the film could have been fantastic. It also could have fleshed out the prologue more, let us know more about the Gaylord family. We need to care more about the characters and we need to sympathize with them more. And the ending needed some major fixing. It basically just gives up at the end. Fiona's problems are solved so poorly that it hurts. Whatever sympathy her character had gained as the film progressed falls apart. It's also far too happy. This story seems moving towards tragedy, or maybe just a sense of historical significance or loss. And we still hate Barclay. And the conflict between the two sisters and Gig is never solved. As bad as Fiona's story ends, Susanna's, Gig's, and Evelyn's is even worse.  I still liked the film. It's thoroughly watchable, even if it doesn't involve us like other great films of the era. 7/10, mostly for its potential. It should have been remade, or the novel should have been re-adapted, at some point during the studio era. It is too dated to be remade now. The 1950s would have been the best time, during the time of films like Giant."
1,"Child 'Sexploitation' is one of the most serious issues facing our world today and I feared that any film on the topic would jump straight to scenes of an explicitly sexual nature in order to shock and disturb the audience. After having seen both 'Trade' and 'Holly', one film moved me to want to actually see a change in international laws. The other felt like a poor attempt at making me cry for five minutes with emotive music and the odd suicide.   I do not believe that turning this issue into a Hollywood tear jerker is a useful or necessary strategy to adopt and I must commend the makes of 'Holly' for engaging subtly but powerfully with the terrible conditions these children are sadly forced to endure. 'Trade' wavered between serious and stupid with scenes involving the death of a cat coming after images that represented children being forced to commit some horrendous acts. I found this unengaging and at times offensive to the cause. If I had wanted a cheap laugh I would not have signed up for a film on child trafficking.   For anyone who would like to watch a powerful film that actually means something I would suggest saving the money on the cinema ticket for the release of 'Holly'."
2,"I understand how much competition holds back the development of youths, I'm a teacher. But good intentions do not encourage learning and hope does not create understanding. Participation, motivation and being truthful with children does(and lots and lots of planning). The kids that watch this take the lesson that you can fall behind, not read, not participate and a miracle will happen. You will be able to pull reason, information and remember content from when you were drawing in class, on the day of the test from your heart, your courage and a magic hidden talent you possess deep inside you. What fools all the teachers who stay up until 1am(and up at 5am) planning for cooperative groups that encompasses multiple learning abilities in children to draw their interest in American literature and encourage them to work hard, have fun and be confident young people. You want a good sports movie moms - watch Little Big League, that's cute, and honest about the importance of fundamentals."
0,"This UK psychological thriller is known in the United States as CLOSURE. Exploitation of X-Files' Gillian Anderson, who plays an attractive middle aged businesswoman of substance named Alice.

On the way home, speeding through the woods on a narrow lane, Alice's auto collides with a deer. After pulling the wounded animal off the road, the couple is savagely attacked by a drunken gang of thugs. Adam is beat to a pulp; Alice is gang raped and both are emotionally and physically devastated by the ruthless attack. When the identities of their attackers are discovered, Alice and Adam set out to exact revenge...brutal revenge. The couple at times find themselves at odds on how to deal with the ruthless attackers. Their final decision is to avenge with no mercy. Let there be no mistake, payback IS hell. Also in the cast: Anthony Calf, Ralph Brown, Francesca Fowler and Antony Byrne. Brutal violence, disturbing images, nudity and graphic rape."
0,"A pretty worthless made for television movie that pretty much follows the killer insect script. Ants mysteriously turn into killer ants near a hotel. I think it is from the hotel food because the sewage from the hotel kitchen drains directly into the ant bed. There is a lack of suspense in this film and it is not scary either. Watching a bunch of ants sting their victims is not very terrifying.  Spoilers section The stupidity of the hero is near incredible. He is told that the health inspector that the ants could not be the hero. It has to be a mysterious virus. After the inspector says this, the hero takes his bulldozer and wrecks the huge ant colony. This disturbs the millions of ants and traps the people in the hotel.  End spoilers Overall, this movie is extremely lame. I don't understand why it got a DVD release when so many deserving movies have none. My only guess for the DVD release is that Suzanne Summers is featured in the film. This is a movie to avoid."
2,"This story is Ah Moon (Chingmy Yau) and Wai, a young couple who move into an apartment in Hong Kong. The movie gets a little convoluted from there, as it seems Moon is having an affair with a guy who is maintaining the pool at their apartment building. I say seems because they are all of a sudden spending time together. I missed the connection, where it came from. Ah Moon dies in a plane crash and the pool guy spots Rosa (also played by Ms. Yau), who looks just like her. You wonder if they will have a relationship. There is a side story involving Tong (the always good Eric Tsang), who is a gay real estate agent. The also always good Sandra Ng plays a laser disc store manager. The problem is, Eric and Sandra's characters are kind of meaningless. Somewhere, there is an excellent film about tragically losing your love and encountering someone who looks just like her, to see if you can fall in love again. The film spends too much time on the relationship of Moon and Wai. I was waiting for Rosa to meet with Wai and see his reaction. Sadly, this film falls short, even though every actor I've seen before (especially Ms. Ng, Ms. Yau and Mr. Tsang) has impressed me with their acting ability. I'm sorry to say I cannot recommend this."
1,"This movie gets it right. As a former USAF Aviation Cadet, I can tell you this movie has it all. The tedium of the application process. The waiting for word. The joy of acceptance. The worry about making it through the course. The sorrow of watching one's buddies (perhaps the best of them)wash out. The anguish of paying the ultimate price - the death of fllow student airmen. The glory of graduation. Always the flying, the flying, the flying. Many are called but few are chosen. We did for pay what we would have eagerly paid to do."
2,"Don Coscarelli's original PHANTASM is one of the best horror/sci-fi movies of all time. I'm not going to just reiterate the story like every other post out there has done. All I'm going to say is, if you have any imagination at all you're going to love this film! This is the one that introduced the killer spheres from which the other films in the series have elaborated upon. PHANTASM is an atmospheric thriller that will make you jump, laugh and possibly scream. The music is excellent as well. If you've only seen an old, crappy video rental and dismissed this as ""some lame 70s flick"" then you have not experienced the glory that is  PHANTASM. Check out the special edition LD or DVD, then maybe you'll learn to appreciate PHANTASM and give it the respect it deserves. 10 out of 10 - perfect!!!!!!"
2,"Well, at least it's nicely filmed with some good shots of Scotland. I say, ""at least"" because this Lassie film was a huge disappointment. I grew up watching the fine television series and thought the movie - especially with the human cast featuring Edmund Gwenn, Donald Crisp and Janet Leigh - would be even better.  Wrong. In fact, the first 30-40 minutes were so bad, I never finished the film. It was boring and annoying. Lassie is afraid of water so the dog's owner, Gwenn, constantly is angry with the dog. Lassie, meanwhile, whimpers and cries the whole time. The whole thing gets irritating, fast!   To be fair, I should have stuck with it. You just know that Lassie will overcome his fear and things will turn out well, as always, I'm sure it got better than the first half that I watched. Nonetheless, filmmaker should learn what sports teams realize the hard way - you have to play hard and well the whole game - not just one half and this film's first half stunk enough so that at least one reviewer went home at halftime."
2,"""Master and Margarita"", the book and the movie:  I have read ""Master and Margarita"" three times, and I am sure that I will read it again. I was very lucky because all three times I read it in Russian, and even the best translation can not compare to the original. Every time, I found something new in the book; it would turn to me by different facets. ""Master and Margarita"" is incredibly beautiful, deep, sophisticated yet playful and sparkling book with unforgettable characters. In fact, it is not one novel but three. First, about the adventures of Devil and his company in the 1920-th Moscow; second, about Pontius Pilatus and Jesus in Jerusalem of the first century, and the third one, about the Master, the writer who wrote the second novel, and his eternal and true love, Margarita. The story of Master and Margarita is the story of Bulgakov and his wife and muse, Elena. All three stories are connected and intertwine. All three of them end with the exactly same phrase, ""...the cruel fifth procurator of Judea, the equestrian Pontius Pilate.""  So, what is the book about? Good, evil, betrayal, talent, love, forgiveness? Yes, it is. But it is so much more.  I had a lot of doubts before watching the film because as much as I wanted to see ""Master and Margarita"" on the screen I was not sure that it was possible to adapt it and not to lose anything important - which is everything.   I am pleasantly surprised - the film is very good. It is respectful, thoughtful and as close to the spirit of the greatest Russian novel of the last century as possible.  The movie is not perfect (and I don't think that the perfect transfer is possible) but the choice of actors, the music score, the visual palette that change as we enter the different eras, places, and dimensions are outstanding. I was initially surprised by some names but almost every actor proved him/herself very capable in bringing to the screen well known and beloved characters. I would say that some of special effects could be ...well, more special - for example, the mischievous talking cat Behemoth could be done more interestingly. I also don't see the exact reason for creating a new character, the man in uniform with the glasses and very recognizable accent who is in charge of investigating the ""crimes of the band of powerful hypnotists"" - how they call Woland and his entourage. One can argue that the titular couple, the tragic lovers, Master and Margarita are weaker and their story seems pale in the comparison to one of Pilat (bravo to 80 year old stage and screen legend, Kirill Lavrov who can be remembered as Ivan Karamazov in The Brothers Karamazov (1969) and Ieshua Ha-Notsri (incredible performance by the young bright star, Sergei Bezrukov of ""Bragada""'s fame, almost unrecognizable as Ieshua). I think no one can deny that Oleg Basilashvili as powerful, cynical and eternally wise Woland, the part of Power "" Which wills forever evil Yet does forever good"" IS the true Master of the film. My fascination and admiration belong to Alexander Abdulov on whom I as a young girl had a huge crush in his early film ""Obyknovennoye Chudo"" . For many years he had been the Russian sex symbol but his enormous comical talent found its match in the part of Woland's assistant/ translator, Koroviev. His and Behemoth's adventures in Moscow are screamingly funny. I think that the film is a successful and enjoyable adaptation of the beloved cult novel and I recommend seeing it. I am going to order the sound track. As I mentioned, the music by Igor Kornelyuk is one of the film's treasures.   P.S. I used to work on the street where the last home of Mikhail Bulgakov was. He was taken to the cemetery from there.  The famous ""Pashkov's House"" with the rotunda on the top where Woland and his team gathered together before they left Moscow forever, was in walking distance from my work, and I remember, once, I almost got hit by the car -I walked and looked at that music in stone and could not take my eyes off it."
2,"Jean Claude Van-Damme has made a few good action movies and more that are not so good. This is not only one of his worst but one of the most horrifying movies I've ever seen. Together with Kickboxer this is Van-Damme at his most brainless and the director, Albert Pyun who can never make it right (Adrenalin, Nemesis 1, 2, 3 and so on) made one of the most low grade movies ever. Some movies may be bad and still have good scenes in them and sometimes one of these scenes may acctually make the whole movie better but here thoose scenes are abscent. There is no acting, there is no action, there is no good scenes and I could even question if this is acctually qualifies as a movie. Enough with the critic. One word: Worthless."
2,"First off, let me start by saying that a 10/10 is not enough. Never have I cried so hard at the end of a film. I even cam home no more than half an hour ago and cried on my bed. This movie really gets to you, and I know that this may sound a bit cliché, but it has everything an excellent film could want. Comedy, drama, romance, mystery. I know some people out there may not agree with me, (like that butt - hole roger ebert who only gave it 2 and a half stars!) however I am finding it difficult to put into words how great this film is, as emotion has swarmed over me. The Curious Case Of Benjamin button is now easily in my top 5 greatest movies of all time. To not see this movie would be a grave mistake. I am so yearning to read the original book. I know this review/comment may sound like someone rambling on but this movie, without a doubt, is perfect. That's the only word I can use to describe The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button...... P-e-r-f-e-c-t. I don't just highly recommend this movie, I hearteningly implore you... nay, beg you to at least watch this film once, as it will leave you swept off your feet with vast amounts of emotion. And that's all i have to say about that.  Adios ! Y'all"
2,"This is a terrible movie. I was embarrassed just watching this movie. Don't give this movie a second of your time. I thought it looked like it might be kind of funny in the video store. Turns out that i just wasted a 1/2 a gallon of gas, $5, and 2 hours of my time to see what is possibly the worst movie in the store.  The spoiler is that you end up wasting your valuable time. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. It should never become a cult classic for being so bad. That's how bad it is. People that refer to this movie as entertaining are merely jerks that want to tick people off.  The actors in this movie should be embarrassed that they ever considered doing this movie. Tori Spelling didn't even want her name in the credits on this movie. Try to guess why."
2,"Evil has many dimensions. It can make you angry, it can make you quiver with fear, it can make you doubt the existence of a kind and loving Supreme Being. For years I've sought Ultimate Evil, ever since I discovered that Plan 9 not only isn't the worst film ever made, it probably shouldn't make the Bottom 20.  And, while I'm always ready & eager to audition new candidates, ""Night of Horror"" may be -- IT. This film turns ALL the dials on the Evil Meter to 11. It will make you angry AND afraid AND plunge you into blackest despair.  Picture this. You take three or four of your lumpiest mullet-headed male buddies and dress them in Confederate uniforms. Put a bucket of dry ice in front of a Ford Gran Torino and turn on the headlights. Have your buddies stand in front of the lights and shift from one foot to the other. That's the sum of your horrifying FX.  Picture this. You see some goat-roper in line at Wal-Mart with 1978 REO Speedwagon hair and so skinny, his jeans fit exactly the same with the fly in the front or the back. That's your male lead. Oh - identify him as a ""California rock singer"" so everybody will know that he's supposed to be terminally hip.  Picture this. You want to establish your female lead as being hopelessly sensitive. So you have her read an Edgar Allen Poe poem to the male lead in the back of an RV. It works too well - his voice-over tells us he's now afraid of losing his cool.  This doesn't give you even a hint of how loathsome Night of Horror is. I've seen it cause even hardened veterans of the Bad Movie Wars to hit the Eject button screaming after the first twenty minutes. Manos at least had the studly cape. Zombie Lake had the naked girls' basketball team treading water. They Saved Hitler's Brain at least had Hitler's head mugging it up in the back seat. But Night of Horror has NOTHING. NOTHING. NOT ONE MOMENT of inspiration, humor, or gratuitous nay-nays. NOT ONE FRAME that doesn't look like it was shot in a koi pond and processed in bongwater.  And this turkey di tutti turkeys ACTUALLY FOUND A DISTRIBUTOR. Do you understand what that means? I have no doubt that all around the world people have worse films sitting in cans in ancient Kelvinators rattling away in mouldering tool sheds, that they just can't make themselves take to the dump. But Night of Horror actually caused money to change hands - somebody screened this excrescence, said, ""Yeah, I think I can make a buck off that,"" and cut Malanowski a check.  We're there. This is it. We've touched bottom. Until Battlefield Earth 2 premieres, The Worst Movie Ever Made."
2,"How someone as workmanlike as director Tay Garnett could take talents the like of Robert Mitchum and Charles McGraw and crank out this piece of sausage is pretty hard to fathom. It's not that the story is so bad for its time (early 1950s), but that the execution is so poor. Mitchum manages to be good insofar as the worst dialog of his career allows him, and McGraw is loaded down with even worse talk. The chemistry between Mitchum and love interest Ann Blyth is nil, the story veers from sickeningly sweet to nauseatingly real (courtesy of some actual combat footage of various people during or just after being roasted alive, etc.), and the majority of the supporting performances are amazingly amateurish for a studio picture of its time. Mitchum plays an infantry officer in Korea at the beginning of the war there. He has a bit of a queasy stomach after slaughtering a bunch of civilian refugees because a few Communist infiltrators were hiding among them, but even his initially outraged girlfriend comes to see that ""even a doctor amputating a leg has to cut off some good flesh with the bad,"" and pretty soon, this mini-My Lai is forgotten (without anyone apparently considering whether a wiser choice than massacre might have existed). But it's the amateurishness of the direction, the high-school-play sort of staging and dialog that make ""One Minute to Zero"" (a title without meaning or explanation in the film) an anomaly: how could these people, whose talent is undeniable, have made such a silly and childish little home movie. The philosophy of war, the details of combat and life in a war zone in general, even the romance, all are done with the sophistication and expertise of the average seven-year-old boy. This is the kind of movie Robert Mitchum was often accused of sleepwalking through, but in reality, were it not for him, it would be utterly unbearable."
2,"We can see the master attempting to hone his craft here. The beginning of the film sets up everything. As a matter of fact, Hitchcock did a great job with exposition in almost every one of his films. So those first ten minutes introduces us to the terror and threat that hangs over the Embankment as a Jack the Ripper type murderer does in his victims. Ivor Novello has trouble keeping a low profile. Considering why he is there, one might think he could try to be a little less suspicious. But then we would not have a movie nor the ultimate mob mentality at work. The young heroin never doubts him, though she really should. He lurks around, runs out at night, and seems like the perfect suspect. All that aside, there is so much mood and atmosphere at work. Hitchcock uses everything that the black and white medium can do to move this picture along. The crowd scene at the end is priceless: Hitchcock's man alone. When he is hung up on the fence, too exhausted to free himself, he becomes a sort of Christ figure; the ""Romans"" jeering at him. This works better than the later sound version, although that is also pretty interesting. HItchcock is able to pull this off and it must have given him great confidence."
2,"Well, it's not very easy these days to come up with an original idea in a genre that's as tired and worn out as the vampire genre, but director Kevin J. Lindenmuth's ADDICTED TO MURDER is a quirky little opus that stylishly blends vampires and serial killers to create an interesting and entertaining flick.  Joel Winter (Mick McCleery) is a quiet and seemingly normal guy who has an uncontrollable desire for murder. His world gets turned upside down when two vampires, Rachel and Angie, get thrown into the mix. With Rachel (Laura McLauchlin), he finds a relationship that satisfies both his murderous desires and, in turn, helps to remind her of what it's like to be human. When Rachel leaves him, Joel vainly tries to recapture that ""special"" relationship that he found with her. He soon meets Angie (Sasha Graham), whose evil intentions lead him to question the nature of his life.  First of all, I was impressed with the above-average production values of the movie. Even though it was shot on video, a lot of effort was obviously put into this by everyone involved. It's intelligently written and directed, it boosts good lighting and editing, it features a great score from Steve Maruzzelli and Hector Milia, and has some well-executed gore and makeup effects from Derek Becker and Ron Chamberlain.  The movie also featured some good performances. Laura McLauchlin and Sasha Graham were definite standouts in the cast. The only real problem was the lead, Mick McCleery. His lack of screen presence really started to tax my nerves after awhile. He's not completely awful, but he sticks out when compared to the rest of the cast.  Despite a few other minor problems (the ""interview"" device used in the movie slowed the pace down a little and some of the dialogue was hard to understand), this has got to be one of the best shot-on-video movies out on the market today, next to SAVAGE HARVEST and SHATTER DEAD! Check it out!"
1,"Kubrick again puts on display his stunning ability to craft a perfect ambiance for a film. Mainly through cinematography, but also using an ingenious score, he creates a chilling and ominous tone that resides over the entire film and thoroughly gets my spine tingling from the start. It really is this flawless ambiance that makes The Shining the masterpiece that it is, in my eyes. Of course it doesn't hurt that Jack Nicholson gives one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. A frighteningly authentic portrayal of a mind gone mad. Duvall and Lloyd are artificial, to be nice, but it's easy to look past those two when the rest of the film is so brilliant. Plus it features the actor with the greatest name of all time (Scatman Crothers)."
0,"Very low-budget police procedural film about homicide detectives trying to solve the murder of a woman whose body turns up in a stolen car in Central Park, and their only clue is a tattoo on her arm. Although released by RKO, this has the look of an independent production that was picked up by the studio for distribution. The cast and crew, with a few exceptions--among them a young and uncredited Jack Lord, director Edward Montagne and cameraman William Steiner--are comprised of complete unknowns, and it shows. The performances are universally sub-par and wouldn't pass muster in a high school training film, the direction is stodgy and choppy and, as mentioned previously, there's no chemistry whatsoever between the lead actors. However, despite the film's many shortcomings, it does have a few good points. The location shooting in New York City, and the film's ultra-low budget, gives it a gritty authenticity much like that of the far superior ""The Naked City"", a shootout in a dark basement is decently handled, and some of the investigating procedures are clever. Otherwise, it's not much to write home about. It is worth a look, however, for a glimpse at the seamier sections of New York City in the early 1950s, and old-car buffs will be ecstatic to see the legions of '30s and '40s cars in the streets.  ."

1,"This is a very funny Ealing comedy about a community in central London who, through an unusual set of circumstances, discover they are not English, but are an annex of the French province of Burgundy.  The film features comic actor Stanley Holloway (best known as Alfred Doolittle in MY FAIR LADY), as well as a host of other classic comic actors of the period.  The story was apparently based on a news item at the time, when the Canadian Government ""officially"" gave a hotel room to a visiting European member of royalty. The idea actually reminded me of the real-life case of the Hutt River Province in Western Australia, where a landowner ""seceded"" from the Australian Government due to a wool quota dispute. (It was never acknowledged by the Western Australian or Australian Governments).  This is a great script that plays with a lot of political and economic issues, rather like the TV show ""Yes Minister""; as well as being a great little eccentric character piece as well."
1,"This movie is one of the masterpieces from Mr. Antonioni. It is about youth, distraction, happiness, alienation, materialism, honor, corruption. And it is like everything else from great Italian director -true art.  "
2,"One of the best documentaries ever filmed. Zwigoff is a genius; Crumb is a genius (eccentric but a genius) and the film is brilliant. If you enjoyed it at all you have to see ""Ghost World"" and ""American Movie"". Cannot recommend it enough."
2,"As a non-Brit it is amazing and certainly amusing to see all the British behave in such a distinct way, only common to the islanders and I do not mean any of that slur which this politicised film tries to mobilise against. For example, scenes in which family is involved, are beautiful characterisations of more or less typical working class households, or rather any British folks.  However, this film as well portrays fair business, the downside of capitalistic societies, in which free market only stops at borders, where nationality defines status and not your labour. Refreshingly, no easy answers are offer, no left-leaning ideologies or right-wing polemics penetrate the film. Thus, it is able to scratch a picture of phenomena without solutions; hence, not very entertaining.  Anyway, it is worthwhile to watch It's a Free World,only if it were for the insightful studies into human behaviour.  Enjoy it."
1,"I loved this show from it's first airing, and I always looked forward to watching each episode every week. The plot, characters, writing, special affects were outstanding! Then the sci-fi channel screwed up yet again and canceled a very entertaining, well written show. I say bring it back, I know all of the actors would come back. I would suggest buying the DVD's, I am. I hope the sci-fi channels executives get word of these comments, and realize that they need to be more involved with their viewers. I only watch one show on that channel now, (Ghost Hunters), but I am fairly sure that shortly they will cancel that too."
0,"I felt like I was watching the Fast and the Furious again, but with different actors and a little bit different plot. I will say the cars in the film are very cool. So, if you like fast cars, then you will probably find this movie mildly entertaining. I also liked Nadia Bjorlin because I've seen her from Days of our Lives. She is a really good singer, but too bad they gave her such lousy songs to sing in this movie. I mean songs about cars; not exactly what you would here on the radio. Since it is a Hollywood film, you have to give this story a little lee way, but in real life I don't think any average joe would come across such a hot girl as Nadia Bjorlin who can drive a race car, fix a car engine, and be a lead singer. It's just all very silly.  Another side note, any one willing to wager 25 million on a car race is a nut. But it was kinda of cool at the end when Natasha stops right before the finish line and screws Michael over. Priceless.  FINAL VERDICT: This movie is for car freaks. So, if you like fast cars, then I'd recommend this."
2,"Here it is, folks: the movie that made ""Jim Carrey"" a household name overnight--""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective."" Although the movie's silly, crude, and often very childish, I still love the damn thing to death. It's a classic. Just one of those movies that you know's great but can't accurately describe why. Maybe because Jim Carrey's the only actor on earth who can pull Ace Ventura off without looking like a complete jackass. Yeah, I think that's it. Can you think of any other actor on earth who could bend over, talk through his rectum, and still manage being funny and make sense? That's what Carrey does here. Ace Ventura is obnoxious, but he makes sense and solves complex cases; he's no idiot. The plot's pretty good for a silly movie. Ace Ventura is hired by the beautiful Melissa Robinson (Courtney Cox) of the Miami Dolphins to retrieve their missing mascot dolphin--Snowflake.  This movie practically made Carrey a superstar overnight. (And even resulted in a funny but inferior sequel entitled--""Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls."") Had this not been made, we'd of never experienced the hilarity of ""Dumb and Dumber"" or ""The Mask."" Jim Carrey's a comedic genius. I miss the Dumb and Dumber/Mask era, when Carrey was in his prime and never took himself or his audiences too seriously.  3 and a half stars"
1,"Blackadder 3 is probably the Blackadder series that people have least heard of - it has basically the same principles as the second and fourth ones and has nothing revolutionary in it. But it is still great - a fiery Duke of Wellington and a fat foolish Dr Johnson (writer of the first dictionary in England) make this series one to be reckoned with. There are still more hilarious one-liners to be delivered in this series, and it brings out the humour in a lesser-known era - in historically accurate and enjoyable episodes. Blackadder's third outing is not the most famous and well-known of the lot, but Rowan Atkinson's role as a butler to a stupid prince is a funny and effectively done one, and Hugh Laurie is at his best in this series. Very good! 9/10"
2,"While this movie may somewhat accurately depict callous British imperialism towards native populations, and is sympathetic to the trod-upon Maori, ""Utu"" (Sumerian for sun, but for the Maori it means revenge) ultimately fails as a story and film because so few of the more prominent foundations that the film lays at the beginning are actually paid off at the end.  For instance, we see the settler Williamson (admirably played by Bruno Lawrence) understandably go mad in his quest to avenge his wife's death and loss of his home at the hand of Te Wheke, going so far as to construct a frightening, custom four-barrel shotgun. Yet does he actually end up using it in the end? He finally gets the opportunity to execute his wife's killer, only to inexplicably back down and instead allow a Maori soldier working for the ""pakeha"" (non-Maori, mostly for white man) to do the deed, apparently mesmerized by Maori chanting and suddenly becoming sympathetic to a culture and cause that is not his own.  Lt. Scott (well played by Kelly Johnson) is torn between his New Zealand roots (a ""pake"" born on the North Island) and his adherence to military life, but understandably seeks his own revenge against Te Wheke for the loss of his Maori lover. As we've seen in other films about the long arm of British imperialism, a soldier's military training ultimately wins out in the end. Yet he too backs down from his final judgment and chance to avenge, to allow the Maori soldier (revealed to be Te Wheke's brother) to perform the execution of Te Wheke.  Te Wheke himself is driven mad by his vengeance against his former employer (the military), when he came across the destruction of a Maori village at the beginning of the film. At first he is depicted as a cunning warrior out to save his fellow Maori, but he makes some very stupid mistakes in the end, ones that defy explanation and logic (unless you buy the ""revenge always trumps intelligence"" line). The soldiers are thus shown as ultimately superior intellects in warfare, and while they may have been, Te Wheke was taken so easily, almost casually so, after months of successful evasion. And why did he turn upon his own people? Does madness make him do this? If so, it's too easy and ultimately unbelievable.  As a prior reviewer posted, why was the Maori village destroyed at the beginning of the film? Should the viewers assume that this is because the British are on a campaign to wipe out the Maori to take their land? Or was it done as some sort of vengeance for supposed affronts to military authority? But this is never explained, so we must take it at face value that the British imperialists were pigs, yet superior nonetheless to the blundering Maori.  Bravo to the filmmakers for exploring the pointlessness and waste of British imperialism and of the concept of revenge, and for showing the dichotomy of Maori killing their own kind in service to a foreign military (as was seen done in India, Africa and countless other island nations and countries during the 1800's British imperialistic campaigns throughout the world), and in alluding to the latent homosexuality of one British officer, further denigrating the indigenous culture they are trying to oppress.  But moviegoers seeking to learn more about Maori culture and history should definitely look for other, more competent and complete sources."
2,"Once again, Jimmy Cagney struts his stuff.....and makes a big name for himself in the very early part of his acting career. He clearly demonstrates that he is a man who take over any scene and dominate it, and the film.  Hollywood found this out in making this film. It is said that Cagney's role was originally much smaller in here but he was so good the script was changed to give him the starring spot....and his career took off from there.  Speaking of billing and stardom, Jean Harlow gets second billing in this film but really has only a bit part; Blondell gets fourth billing has only a few lines.  The story is a fast-mover and the movie is over in less than an hour-and-a-half. The cinematography in here is excellent and DVD really brings that out.  The famous ""grapefruit scene"" with Cagney shoving the fruit in Mae Clark's face wasn't that big a deal back then and the scene happens so fast you almost miss it.  For me, a highlight of the show was simply the facial expressions on Cagney. At the end of the movie, as he stands in the pouring rain getting ready to go in and kill people, his expression is downright scary - a very powerful scene.  The ending of this movie is memorable, too. In all the film may be dated but it still very, very watchable and one of the great crime movies of all time."
0,"What in God's name happened here? How does one go about creating what is practically a cheap knockoff of Redneck Zombies? Was Zombie '90 ever supposed to entertain someone ...anyone, or even make a dollars profit? But mainly, what happened here?   Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence was directed by a lunatic by the name of Andreas Schnaas, who specializes in earth-shattering gore films, such as Goblet of Gore, and Anthropophagus 2000, and some of which contain profanity in the titles. In the gore department, this one isn't much different than the rest. Although, the level of ineptness ...well, earth-shattering.  Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence is as bad as Peter Jackson's Dead-Alive is gory, think about it.  Getting too specific with the story would be a waste of time. An accident, involving chemicals causes the dead to come back, and eat the living. Never has the concept been treated in such a manner. The gore effects are a whole, new low. Just a Z-grade nightmare. I can't tell whether, or not this was originally meant to be funny, somehow, I doubt the English dubbing was being very true to the original script, but stranger things have happened. The whole thing just reminds me of a shot-on-video introduction to a Troma movie, except it lasts a hell of a lot longer.  I've seen only one film that was worse than this, The Chooper.  For proof that Andreas Schnaas is an actual director, I would highly recommend Nikos The Impaler If you think you have no standards in what you look for in a bad movie, give Extreme Pestilence a try, but you've been warned. It takes nerves of steel to make it all the way through. But if gore is all you're here for, then you might be able to stomach this one. Other than that, no atmosphere, no, and I mean NO budget, no entertainment value, but mostly, no pride. Show some pride, Schnaas. 1/10   Updated 7/5/09: After a few more viewings of Zombie '90, I've had a change of heart, or I guess I just get it now. Zombie '90 is hilarious, so nevermind the harsh words, Although, Extreme Pestilence still only deserves one star."
2,"Wild Women! Bootleg hooch! Hot jazz! Sequins and furs! Blackmail! Suicide! This pre-Code cautionary tale opens with a typical disclaimer stating ""It is our earnest hope that this film may arouse you..."" Of course, they mean arouse your indignation to help eliminate such vices as you view in this exposé. Or, do they?  Pleasant juvenile Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., headlines along with a bevy of largely talent-free ""party girls"". Judith Barrie has some especially embarrassing scenes, leading one to wonder whether she may have gotten her part by being a party girl. Almeda Fowler, making her film debut as Maude ""Don't call me Madam"" Lindsay, and veteran actor John St. Polis put in decent performances adding some humor. The well regarded Earl Burtnett and His Hotel Biltmore Orchestra from Los Angeles provides suitable jazz accompaniment.  The best scene is the party where guests arrive in their automobiles via a service elevator directly to the party. The much commented upon perfumed fountain scene seems to have been excised from the version available from Alpha Video. Altogether, this is a pleasant diversion that pushes the envelope even for pre-Code Hollywood."
2,"For a start I'm not interested in adding nothing new in this review.""Fear Runs Silent"" has a good premise,but this premise is completely wasted.Director Serge Rodnunsky doesn't create almost any atmosphere(apart from the beginning,which is pretty creepy),instead he fills this trash with so many annoying flashbacks.The ending is totally awful:after all these grisly events it all turns into dream!!!Yeah right,what a load of s***!!Three stars:one for a funny performance by Stacy Keach as a biologist,one for beautiful photography,and finally one for the beginning.Avoid this mess like the plague."
2,"Much has been made in these pages about this film, as far as not being a true story. This inspired account about an injured horse the Crane family bring back to life, is one of the most engaging films about the racing sport in memory. Of course, this is no ""Seabiscuit"", but the film makers are not claiming it to be.  John Gantins, the director and writer of this picture, knows what to give the public. Aside from the heart warming feeling in the film, he was blessed with a cast that does justice to the material. The love of a young girl for a horse, that by all accounts should have been shot because of the injured it suffered during an accident, is the stuff that makes good family movies.   ""Dreamer, Inspired by a True Story"" is totally dominated by Dakota Fanning's presence in the film. Miss Fanning, is a luminous young actress the camera adores. She is a natural, as she shows in this film. Dakota Fanning has the uncanny ability of being real at all times. Her love for Sonador and her determination to take the horse to the Breeders' race consumes her, as well as her family.  Kurt Russell is also good as Cale's father. He is a man of principle who loves what he does best, bringing horses to their full potential. Kris Kristofferson plays the grandfather who wants Cale to succeed and in the process he is reunited with his son. Elizabeth Shue is seen as a mother who has to work to help meet ends when her husband loses his job. David Morse, one of the best character actors around doesn't have much to do, and the same goes for the wonderful Luis Guzman, playing one of the stable men.  The film is recommended for families with children. Mr. Gantins created an excellent entertainment that will satisfy young and old because it shows a young girl with a firm resolution to do the right thing for the horse she loves."
2,"My Take: Terrific special effects make this film worth a million bucks.   Through their discovery of the magic of CGI, Disney has brought their own expensive big-budget CG spectacle called DINOSAUR in 2000. Although CGI has already brought to life dinosaurs before in JURASSIC PARK and its sequel THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK, sometimes DINOSAUR has certainly improved from which it started from. The special effects in DINOSAUR are truly spectacular. What's fantasy and what's reality is now indistinguishable.  In terms of plot and story, however, DINOSAUR is still not well developed. The story is nothing new and for Disney, that's quite a disappointment. Disney, a master in both animation and storytelling, is now lacking in a new story to show. Still, nonetheless, DINOSAUR is still a wonderfully good-looking fantasy that appeals to kids and adults.  The story is nothing original, as Disney simply owes from other animated movies, some of which is their own. The plot that dinosaurs, after a meteorite strike, creates a large famine leading to a search for a valley of fertility is recycled from both a segment in Disney's FANTASIA called ""The Rite of Spring"", as well as Don Bluth's animated THE LAND BEFORE TIME. The lead character, an Iguanadon named Aladar, is separated from his mother, who is supposedly dead, is like the character of BAMBI in Disney's own animated film of the same title. The rest of the characters aren't new with any zing.  Still, the film is an enjoyable showcase of fine special effects and excitement. It's still good as visual entertainment. A lot more fun to look at rather than to think about. I liked just looking at the very colorful effects, showing us numerous sights of dinosaurs of all shapes and sizes. The opening scenes were the most colorful, where we are taken to flight in the wings of a flying Pteranodon, switching from various scenery that is a breathtaking sight. There's a lot of imagination that went to the effects, and the heart is not forgotten.  Rating: **** out of 5."
2,"I just watched this movie on Movie Time and not even Kevin Sorbo could keep me watching this waste of film. All this movie is is a lot of testosterone mixed with pretty women. Jesus if I wanted to watch a pretty boy killing people off I'd watch The Legend of Hercules not this atrocity.   Please ladies if you see this movie in the stores RUN. RUN hard, RUN long, and RUN fast because I wasted about 10 minutes of my otherwise active life watching this movie and I feel like it was a really big waste of 10 minutes of my life and 3.5 hours of their film.  It was really stupid and machismo stuff aimed at 15 year old boys and if I had a 15 year old boy I certainly wouldn't let him watch this."
2,"Wow! Not one of Fulcis best! Actually quite dreary, devoid of suspense and atmosphere. I should also say logic, but thats not to be expected from a Fulci-flick. Its sad because the locations look quite good, and this could have been an effective movie if he'd had the skills. There is virtually no buildup of tension, the music is boring and the dubbing of the kid is annoying. There are some attempts at foreboding images, like the picture of the house and the mannequin, but they are not enough to sustain interest. The subplot with a little girl from the past is poorly handled and the Freudstein ending is totally laughable. Even a movie with nonlinear and dreamlike structure should have some focus and coherence. Fulci managed that in his effective ""The Beyond"" but here it is completely absent. For fans only."
2,"Not the worst movie ever, but not even mediocre. Set at beginning of summer break, yet the season is quite obviously fall. Although I've seen both leads in other films that were fairly good, this one really leaves good effects and acting behind. The story is old, the filming is discount and the graphics moderate at best. Once finished, it may be that you feel dismay at never getting those two hours back. Life's too short for films of this caliber, so go throw a ball with your kid or take your spouse to dinner. Many activities would be less a waste of time. The music gets at least a four out of ten. All in all, good movie to throw on in the background while you're cleaning out your laptop files."
1,"I think it's one of the greatest movies which are ever made, and I've seen many... The book is better, but it's still a very good movie!"
2,"I am confused by the magnanimous praise for this film. First of all, let me respect it for its unsensational style. It expressed the everyday unromantic experience of what it must have been like then. In this way, it avoided Hollywoodism, but when I consider how the film-makers could have incorporated vast vistas as a cinematic expression of the isolation of these communities I was dismayed. These people lived in immense isolation, but all we were given 90 percent of the time were tight shots, and landscapes were generally presented as one section of the pebbly beach with some stark rocky islands off shore. And let us consider the opening (of the version I saw). There was no attempt at establishing the historical context. Instead, we got close shots that could have been anywhere, and certainly shot in the style for 'straight to video"". Come on! The script was clever, with the potential for a great dramatic experience, but the director must have been limited by a highly restrictive budget, because it ended up looking like 'made for TV'. The synthesized music was occasionally effective but surely deeper chords would have created an ominous atmosphere. The hero did not really have any tense challenges. He seemed to cruise through it all. While I sort of liked him, I never had a sense of his jeopardy. In short, there was no dramatic tension. In this sense, there was an echo of some of Clint Eastwood's movies, but without the stylishness. There was an assumption that we were on the protagonist's side, but why deprive us of his human vulnerability as he seeks revenge? I feel that the writers deserve a bigger budget to prove to us that they can create a truly cinematic experience rather than a small dimension TV drama. I have not seen the subsequent 2 parts of the trilogy."
2,"I don't claim to be an expert in Bengali literature (far from it), but I have always found stories coming out of Bengal to be a class apart. The characterization, the depth of the plot, the sincerity of the human emotion in those stories are the among the finest to be found anywhere. Kabuliwala is another such great movie to be based on a Bengali story.  Sharmila Tagore is superb, Vinod Mehra plays the grown up Nandu with great sincerity. Rajesh Khanna lends a lot of credibility to Anand-babu despite having turned a major superstar during the making of this movie. Om Prakash is always a pleasure to watch although his role is very small. R.D.Burman and Kishore Kumar top it all off with the great music!"
0,"As I write this review in 2008, we are mired in a remake culture. Movie studios seem determined to ruin as many classic films as they can with thoroughly pointless updates including 'King Kong, 'The Wicker Man' and practically every film that ever starred Michael Caine. This lazy remake mentality is not a new phenomenon, however, as 'Dough for the Do-Do' proves. An entirely pointless colorized version of Bob Clampett's surreal masterpiece 'Porky in Wackyland', 'Dough for the Do-Do' sucks the life out of the original by splashing colour all over Clampett's original footage and adding some lame new footage overseen by Friz Freleng. Freleng was an entirely unsuitable director to be tampering with Clampett's source material, although in truth no director could hope to come close to Clampett's inspired insanity. Inevitably, then, 'Dough for the Do-Do' is nothing more than the raping of a classic with an appalling new title attached. For cartoon fans like myself, its equivalent to a colorization of 'Casablanca'."
1,"I enjoyed Albert Pyun's ""Nemesis"" for its cheesy action and semi-complicated script. A lot of people complain about the ""confusing"" plot to the first film, which is probably why ""Nemesis 2: Nebula"" has a dumb as rocks plot with the same super-action to carry it through.  This one gives the name of the first movie's hero, Alex, to a bulked up super-female sent to the past to save the future. She is raised by a tribe in Africa. A good portion of the film only has dialogue in an African tongue without subtitles, which I liked because it made it seem somewhat authentic (how often do movies in this genre really try to do that?). It doesn't take long for the evil cyborgs to time travel back in time to find her and try to kill her.  Don't get me wrong, this is a piece of crap (not that the first one was anything great). There are subplots involving Africa's political unrest, treasure hunting, and tribal combat. The picture is very short on brains, so none of these things gets a very good treatment. The picture is basically a drawn out fight with some chases that boils down to muscle-babe vs. cyborg. It has its entertainment value, just don't expect quality, or anything of the first movie."
2,"The author of the excellent 'All Heads Turn As The Hunt Goes By', John Farris, wrote his version of 'Carrie' after that novel's success as book and film; it was called 'The Fury'. It also explored the subject of telekinesis (moving objects with the mind), but he stretched it over a broader, international canvas and threw a terrorism subplot, a fractured love story, an Argento-inspired school for cute, gifted girls, telekinetic rivalry, and John Cassavetes as an evil puppetmaster of troubled psychic warriors into the brew. Assisted immeasurably by John William's devastating, baroque score, Brian De Palma's film of Farris's screenplay is another example of stunning visual storytelling. Losing the direct Hitchcockian references, De Palma applies a harder, leaner style to the storytelling and creates a powerful work that is less fun than his later films, but no less compelling. As always, there are a number of stand-out sequences, and the stand-out sequence in this is Amy Irving's escape from the institute where she is being groomed for ""evil"" by the charming but twisted Cassavetes. Irving's flight into the street, shot in slow motion, is cinema at its purest, most transporting and erotic (Irving is wearing a nightie). William's scoring of this sequence is stunning. A carousel accident, orchestrated by ""evil"" psychic Andrew Stevens (in a chilling performance), has great entertainment value, and the liberal use of blood and bulging prosthetic facial veins goes a long way towards elevating this film to cult status. The finale, which features an exploding head (a pre-""Scanners"" exploding head, mind you) is simply bloody great."

2,"This movie is one of the best YAAS movies I have seen recently. - Good actors, great effects, even music is great and everything is full of action. It keeps watchers focused on USA flag all the time. Sure, like as always USA saves the world from catastrophe. - God save us all."
2,"Something is too different tahn how it is seen. You can understand the real event only by going too deep, but you can face something you dislike.  An ordinary,lover class town in Istanbul and a murder affair happens. And than with the aid of 6 characters we enter into the event.  I think this is one of the most wonderful Turkish movies in last years. And this film has been sent for Oscar change from Turkey this year. I think everybody should see this film to understand real power of cinema without colofful scenes and special effects."
0,"So it has come to this. Fast, expensive cars that only the upper 1% will ever drive. The girls that pose next to them in gearhead magazines. Second-tier and no-name actors. Cheap promotional appearances by people from niche culture.   This is the garbage that Hollywood has to offer. Don't get me wrong; I love the mindless action flick with hot chicks as much as the next guy. But please, will the collective Braintrust that greenlights this stuff please stop, count to ten, breathe, have a hearty ""Woooooosaaaaaah"", then rewind twentyfive years and recall what made movies enjoyable once upon a time? Then actually MAKE some movies like that again?   I have nothing against poker, but the entire pop-culture explosion it has enjoyed over the past five years is ridiculous. Everyone and their mother thinks their Maverick now (not that half of them even will get that reference). Some executive said, ""Hey, what demographic do you want to leach $9.50 out of?"" ""I know, sir. The 18-35 market."" ""Ok, let's give them poker, girls, and fast cars."" ""Brilliant idea, sir."" The result? A film that I've seen a hundred times late at night on Spike TV, and more often than not, starring Dolph Lundgren.   Now don't misunderstand me;I am not a film snob. Over-the-top artsy flicks like The English Patient don't float my boat, but generic films that should not have even been made straight to DVD bother the hell out of me too. Only adolescent gearheads will have their engines revved by this, and I imagine the ones in the higher end of their IQ range will see this for what it is: a junkyard."
2,"As with 98% of horror movies from the 90s to present this film is missing that ""raw"" video, which made horror movies in the 70s and 80s so scary, they felt real, it was the basic nature of them, the true to life scenarios and the film quality itself that gave it that gritty realism. This movie, while entertaining, is your typical cinematic horror movie just like the previous Texas Chainsaw. In my opinion it is hard to capture that raw, uncut feel that makes a horror movie scare me, Besides the amazing work done in House of a 1000 corpses no movie prior to that from the 90s to present scared me, simply entertainment. And while House of a 1000 corpses didn't make me scared for my life it definitely captured that 70s vibe and quality that is missed by so many of these films."
0,"I have just lost three hours of my life to this travesty, and I can honestly say I feel violated. I had read the reviews and heard the warnings, and I thought I was prepared for anything - at best I thought, a faithful (if misguided) attempt at an original adaptation; at worst, a so-good-it's-bad ""Plan 9"" for the new millennium. So when I managed to pick up a copy in Walmart while in Florida and brought it back to the UK, I joked to my friends ""Prepare for the worst movie ever made!"" Oh, cruel Karma. There is absolutely NOTHING to recommend this film. The ""special"" effects look like the work of a first year design student using a Spectrum ZX81. The acting is terrible, the accents are WORSE than terrible (one artillery mans' accent seems to take us on a tour of the British Isles, from Scotland to Wales via Northern Ireland), the dialogue is stilted, the editing is non-existent, the production values prove that no expense has been gone to. Words really cannot describe how bad this movie is; from the Union Flag flying from the horribly CGI'd Thunderchild (the Royal Navy flies the White Ensign, NOT the Union flag) to the woodworm ridden acting, this is quite simply a crime against film making. When you consider some of the literally-zero-budget fan films that are available on the 'net (the Star Wars short ""Troops"" for example), the whole ""we're enthusiastic amateurs"" argument goes right out of the window. And if you believe an interview with Hines on the Pendragon website, this film had an 8 figure budget! I can only assume that dodgy facial hair does not come cheap in the US. Maybe the problem is that Hines & co tried to make a film of the book, rather than turn the book into a film (if that makes any sense). Characters and extras spout chunks of text verbatim without trying to convey the feelings behind the words. Ironically enough, the ONLY person who even came close to giving a decent performance was Darlene Sellers, the ex-soft porn actress. My advice? Pray like crazy that Jeff Wayne doesn't screw up, and go watch the Spielberg version. It may not be true to the text of the book, but I can say this; As a lifelong HG Wells fan (and Englishman as well) Speilbergs film IS true to the Spirit of the book. Maybe customs were wrong to let me carry this monster into the country, but I will say this: Timothy Hines stole three hours of my life, and I want them back."
2,"Rarely do i watch a foreign action movie that has the quality of this one. I have never actually posted to this sight before but I found this movie to be so excellent that I thought I would. Some might liken this to other assassin vs assassin movies but i disagree. This movie is so much more in depth in the story line you forget that it has subtitles. Others have commented on how well it flows from one language to another. I didn't notice since I was so involved. Great action - not a Michael Bay action fest but enough to keep you interested and then some. Great plot, nothing unique yet was done with such style and pizazz that you thought you were getting something original. Great ending, not going to give any spoilers but I was very pleased."
0,"I mistakenly kept myself awake late last night watching this thing. About the only thing I could say good about this horrid film is that it could be used by film schools to show how not to make a movie. No proper character development, wait, I'm not even sure they were characters. Set-ups were hokey and inane, and the overuse of split screens was wasted since sometimes they couldn't even synchronize with alternate shots. If I could give this a zero or minus rating I would. Sadly, it isn't even worth the time for a few laughs.   It's just a sad example of money wasted by Hollywood, and now I waste my time even thinking about it."
2,"First off, just to let you know, Queen Latifah cannot act, she has about as much acting ability as my left nut, just because someone can go on-screen and play themselves, over and over again, does not mean they can act, second off, I wouldn't even have had to watched this movie to tell you it's a piece of crap, the only reason I watched it's 'cause I work at a video store and it was playing on the tele, even then I stopped looking up after five minutes and tried to block out as much of the useless chit chat they were spitting out, and I can tell I'm not the only one who didn't like it 'cause people where walking out faster then they were coming in. This is, what I like to call Hollywood Hogwash, targeted towards 9-13 year old girls, and 12-14 year old boys, I wouldn't add this DVD to my collection even if it was given to me for free with a $100 bill inside. I find it very sad that a movie like this can actually be made and distributed. Five minutes into it and I can already name three things wrong with it, (1) The opening scene, with Queen Latifah doing stunts on the bicycle, Matt Damon as a super agent I can almost believe... (2) Queen Latifah in lingerie, a well pampered poodle is still a poodle, meaning a mutt's a mutt (3) then there's the scene where she's working on her taxi all night, in lingerie mind you, why??? when she's done, she's all clean, oh well, at least we were spared a shower scene!!!"
2,"I hadn't even heard of this movie until recently. I'm an aviation/WW2 fan, and I've always enjoyed Gregory Peck's films, so I figured what the heck.  Peck plays an emotionally scarred Canadian pilot flying with Commonwealth pilots in Burma in WW2. It looks like the planes they fly are done in Australian Air Force Markings, but I'm not certain on that count.  As other reviewers have stated, he meets a nice Burmese girl, and begins to come back emotionally. Unfortunately, he's downed in the wilderness with and injured man and a third uncooperative officer.  The story is somewhat predictable, and by the numbers for sure. I feel that it has aged relatively well though due to the largely excellent characterizations created by the actors and author. Of course, the special effects in this 52 year old film aren't up to today's standards, but I found them passable.  The film is beautifully shot and the location photography often breathtaking.  My only gripes are minor, the kind of thing that prevented the film from being a 10 in my books.: The officer who is burned in the crash lies there like an idiot, screaming until his companions throw sand on him to put out the flames. He had the stop and drop, but neither will do any good without the roll. Plus, the gore/makeup standards of the day prevented the filmmakers from showing anything truly horrific, so his injuries seemed pretty minor. The script required one of the three to be incapacitated, and the could have/should have come up with something better, like 2 broken legs.  The character of Bloor is a little too one dimensional, and the conflict between him and Forrester is much too on the nose. Surely a more subtle rising disagreement could have been created.  Minor mistakes that no person in his right mind would have made if it were real: After Bloor dies, Forrester leaves his hat there. As I watched it, I was saying to myself: ""Grab that hat"".  When Forrester leaves the navigator to march on by himself, he doesn't move him under shelter so that he'll have shade when the sun comes up. Plus he takes only one empty canteen with him on his quest for water.  On the plus side, there were some nice touches that I found very good. I really enjoyed the interaction between Forrester and Ana. I thought it was well acted, written and filmed.  I also found the picture of Bloor's wife and family very touching. Before dying, the last thing he did was look at this picture of his wife, whom we are previously informed is the love of his life. When we the audience finally see the picture, she's an average to homely looking woman. For me that greatly enhanced the realism of Bloor's character and the finality of his death.  And finally, the movie had excellent production values, good plane footage and dirt under the nails location photography.  Check it out!"
2,"I started watching The man thinking that the film was going to be one of the worst movies I have seen in my entire life.But,there was a surprise:the film was only very bad,but not one of the worst movies I have ever seen.That's the best thing I can say about this bad film.The movie is predictable and the formula it has is very used.The story is irrelevant and the film is crap from the beginning until the end.Eugene Levy and Samuel L.Jackson are excellent actors but they are wasted here.The script is simply pathetic.''Director''Les Mayfield continues with his pathetic career(which includes craps like Flubber and Blue streak).The man is a pathetic film and I do not recommend it."
1,"This is one of the funniest series ever! I laughed till my sides split and rolled around on the floor. If only someone would release in America. Region 0 or 1 - Non-PAL please.   I know it being released in the UK but that's Region 2 and PAL besides! Let's give this series its fair shake. America must know this series. Moffat is a genius. I loved Tracie Bennett's quirky, goofy role in this. Of course I liked Fiona Gillies! But Tracie was a treasure!  Release this show in America! or Show it again on the PBS stations. I need to laugh and laugh again! Please indulge us, please! Please!  Thanks for reading."

2,"Macho jack of all trades Axel McGregor (Donald Pleasence) whose past gigs have included test pilot, race car driver, and writer, hunts a lethal black leopard in the jungles of Thailand. When the beast gets the drop on him, he becomes despondent over his fear, so when it actually gets captured, he lets it go just so he can hunt it again and exact some sort of vengeance for being humbled so badly. This, just as his estranged daughters Leslie and Georgia (Nancy Kwan and Jennifer Rhodes) arrive for a visit, with Georgias' daughter Peggy (Lesly Fine) and local tour bus operator Ross (Ross Hagen) in tow.  This material had some potential, and it does have some atmosphere going for it. That said, I don't think it's particularly well made, well written, or well acted. (Although Hagen is very amiable and it's a hoot to see Pleasence really go off his rocker here.) The leopards' stalking scenes aren't bad, but the actual attack scenes left something to be desired. This is never as scary or as suspenseful as I would have liked; it's basically watchable, but barely so.  Location shooting in Thailand helps, anyway. The photography is decent enough and the music sometimes effective. But this plodding movie ended up leaving me wanting more.  4/10"
2,"James Woods must've been desperate to pay the bills when he accepted the lead role in this seriously flawed suspense/action flick. For a man of such immense talent, this is a total waste.  Scripters and director James B. Harris have done their very best to destroy what was probably a good plot, based upon the novel ""Blood on the Moon"" by James Ellroy, about an obsessive serial killer whose love for a prudish, feminist poet type drives him to commit horrid crimes while an uptight detective hunts him in the name of all the disillusioned young women...................................well, maybe the plot wasn't so good to begin with, but certainly Harris and company have done a great job in smothering what value there may have been. Any remnants of a storyline are washed out as the focus is pure vengeance. But it's a little hard to care about the way the characters feel when you don't care for the characters themselves.  Charles Durning, Lesley Ann Warren and Raymond J. Barry also conspire to throw away their collective acting prowess along with Woods. Apart from all the short comings afore mentioned, there really can be nothing else to say about what is a definite failure.  Saturday, February 15, 1997 - Video"
2,"Sometimes I'm a sucker for a romantic movie, more rarely, when the black mood takes me, I want to rip out the protagonists innards and dance on them. Yesterday was such a day. I finished watching this movie which I'd started watching a few days ago, back when I was of the opinion that romantic movies were just lovely. I have two major bones to pick with the entire oevre and they both relate to the same basic concept, the indoctrination of helpless saps like me with bullshit romantic shite like this.  1. Being a helpless girlie who's just a little bit crazy and whines about how hard her life is will not cause all men within a hundred foot radius to fall in love with you no matter how perky your nose/breasts are.  2. That thing! That thing with the meeting and the moon eyes and the first date sex and the brief comedy misunderstanding leading to the immediate reunion and forgiveness cause you're just both so much in tune. It doesn't happen! And if it does why does it never happen to me!? I hate to be a cynic but I am one of those people that thinks if Romeo and Juliet hadn't offed themselves they probably wouldn't have lasted a year.  It's not that I want to believe that. I wasn't born cynical, I was turned. I am a bitter romantic. I went out into the world all doe-eyed and hopeful and offered myself up on the bloody alter of love and rather unsurprisingly, I got butchered. I wasn't prepared. They should make you watch Witness and that Jennifer Connelly movie with the double ended dildo and The Ice Storm before you hit puberty instead of crap like this."
1,"I spent 5 hours drenched in this film. Nothing I have ever seen comes close to the delicious funk this film left me in. Never mind females advanced aging dilemma's, human fear vaults off the screen for your viewing. Personally engaging to the ninth degree, the film invests one with an undeniable shared feeling for our lives'. I enjoyed this dalliance with raw wounded gall deep from within. It empowers a mutually shared vestment in the history of human encounters reaching far deeper into the pain, isolation and skewed views of self and others. The result forgives our tepid forming of a bridge away from the muddy sludge of dead we must encounter. The birth in finding real people is a happy pursuit. The effort for realism intersects with the dark ground of our bankrupt culture."
2,"This is a well-cast, well-directed, tightly-scripted film (only 87 minutes). The cast is amazing for what had to be a fairly low budget RKO picture from the mid-1950's; Randolph Scott was an established star while Forrest Tucker, J. Carrol Naish, and Denver Pyle were all established, talented Western performers and Edgar Buchanan was one of the best Western character actors of all time. What hurts the movie severely and is its major flaw is the setting. Nothing about one single shot of the film looks anything like Southern Indiana or anywhere else in the Midwest, and exactly like California, where it was actually shot. This lack of authenticity is distracting, in some scenes more than others, but never completely destroys the fine performances. Like some of the others, I would like to know more about the historical Reno Brothers and how closely this film represents their true story; I'm sure that it's somewhat closer than Elvis' ''Love Me Tender'', which is about the same topic and came out the next year."
2,"If you're looking for a comedy with weird plot twists and a sprinkling of humor, then you'll still be searching - Bride Wars excels at the former and sadly fails at the latter. It's not entirely silly sabotage and witless laughs as a few scenes and characters do stand out of the cliché wedding comedy crowd, but ultimately the tragic outcomes and easy clean-up of a far too messy situation will leave viewers wishing for a more comfortably predictable plot line.  Liv (Kate Hudson) and Emma (Anne Hathaway) have been best friends since childhood and both have always dreamed of a gorgeous June wedding at the luxurious Plaza Hotel. When both girls' boyfriends ask for their hands in marriage, Liv and Emma enlist the highly reputable wedding planner Marion St. Claire (Candice Bergen) to acquire their dream locale. Unfortunately a clerical error has their weddings set on the same day and thus begins a rivalry of increasingly ruthless sabotage as both girls refuse to reschedule their most important day.  No experimentation or originality can be seen in Bride Wars. Everything is terribly formulaic, from the music-narrated montages to the carefully patterned dialogue to the high points and low points for each of the heroines. When a half-expected love triangle forms, it is completely unnecessary and sorely mislaid - this is the kind of film where each event is better off contributing solely to comedy and every sad moment is best coated with ridiculous gags and off-the-wall mood-shifting resolutions. Touches of seriousness have no place in Bride Wars, which struggles so greatly with its adult dilemmas that the moments of humor feel forced - shoved into the cracks to even out the heartbreak most won't be feeling for these cookie-cutter characters.  If it wasn't bad enough that no individuality finds its way through all the girl-oriented giggling, hormonal wedding craze and subdued cat-fighting, the humor itself is oftentimes indecipherable from the drama. Sometimes it's funny to see these girls bitterly attack one another even if we're meant to sympathize, and other times it's disheartening when we're supposed to be laughing. Either way, so little of the film sparks interest or concern over two hopelessly contrived, generic best friends that it would be as wasteful to debate over them as it was to spoil two hours of valuable time watching the film. Hopefully even the target audience will realize the recycled, uninspired nature of Bride Wars.  - The Massie Twins"
2,"This is probably one of the worst horror movies of the 90's.The story is dumb,the cast is mostly annoying and if you want scares...check better somewhere else.Even not enough blood to satisfy gore-hounds.Only one good thing about this horrible picture:quite well-made creature effects.In my opinion,due to such ridiculous films horror genre is slowly dying.So my advice to you is simple:avoid this dreadful piece of crap."
2,"Bruce Lee stars as Billy Lo, an action star (of the martial arts variety) who mobsters are trying to force to sign with them, however after taking a couple of beatings and an assassination attempt, Lo fakes his death, has reconstructive surgery and looks to teach the mobsters what the meaning of ""No"" is. Game Of Death is Bruce Lee's worst movie. This is an obvious truth. In terms of quality Game Of Death is sometimes even lower than Bruce Le or Bruce Li's movies. The sequence where Bruce Lee's face is pasted over the mirror (As others have mentioned) is truly as shoddy as it gets and overall the movie has a few alright action sequences in the beginning but it's all very sub-par stuff. That is until Bruce Lee takes on Danny Inasanto and Kareem Abdoul Jabbar and of course which boosts its rating into low mediocrity. Also of notice (Though it's all blatantly obvious even to those who have never seen a Bruce Lee movie) is the use of a stand in, in which the stand in wears sunglasses, bandage over his face, an old man's costume and of course a hilariously bad fake beard. All of this is laced with Bruce Lee footage from his earlier movies. Usually to a closeup of Lee stock footage then followed by the stunt double's back. In other words this is a very badly made movie but what makes it worth watching at least on a genre level is the climax which is awesome in its crispness and pace. In fact the only thing that leaves an impression on one after watching this, is how much better Lee's original version would've easily been had he lived to complete it because as we know Robert Clouse added 90% new footage and made it into what we got here. Still worth a look for die hard fans (Like me) who will watch anything with Bruce Lee. Because of the awesome climax Game Of Death earns mediocrity the same way an A+ on a test would bring a grade of a D+ up to a C-.  * * out of 4-(Fair)"
2,"There is no doubt about it, but when Hollywood decides to make a cinematic masterpiece, and at the same time draws upon indigenous American social and cultural mores, as exemplified by a writer of the talent of Carson McCullers, the result can be both breath-taking and almost overwhelming. It is partly their very `Americaness' that makes films like THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER so unique and special to someone like myself who is not American. And this film in particular shows a side of the American psyche which is all too often neglected and unacknowledged in movies. The novel on which it is based is, sadly perhaps, too complex and long to adapt to the screen without sacrificing some aspect of the many subplots it contains, and although I regret the loss of the radical political dimension, the subtle and heart-wrenching way loneliness, racism, impoverishment, snobbery, and disadvantage are conveyed are so powerfully treated that the end result is a film of almost unbearable sadness and melancholy... and yet... And yet there is an element of tremendous hope also at work; of the human spirit overcoming huge odds and learning life's lessons as the various characters go along and work out their individual destinies. Superb ensemble acting from all concerned, and technical credits of the highest order make this one of the most deeply satisfying films I have ever seen in my life. A masterpiece, and one that could only have been made in the USA."

1,"This film is a delightful, light hearted look at both sides of where the ""club kid"" rave scene blends with the New York art, music and performance art worlds (with a cameo by the omnipresent Miss Bunny). This is ""Torch Song Trilogy"" for the perky-post-teen girls. ""That Girl"" for our disaffected, affected millennium times.  The dialogue is fast and funny, and Parker Posey's costumer deserves - if not an academy award, at least - a stadium ""wave"" of kudos.  Of course, this film rests on the very stylish platform heels of Miss Posey, and she is perfectly cast. Like a lot of her acting work, it may not be very deep, it is often self-referential and, well, posey... but it all WORKS. She is a talented comedienne, an incredible entertainer, and this film entertains, she carries it on her shoulders like a faux leopard wrap, and never lets it drop to the floor.  Mary is a superficial party fashionista who isn't above stealing designer clothing from a friend's closet or making out with someone else's boyfriend. On a deeper level, this is a story of a girl and her friends who are care-less in every sense of the word, including about other people; and the process of learning that caring is necessary to life.   The script is beautifully crafted, witty, and the only performance that disappoints is the Aunt, in a role that was much too one-dimensional and heavy handed; a more nuanced performance from her, would have deepened the relationship between the two... but... hey... this is comedy. A surprisingly deep role, that gives this film some substance and world vision, is the fallafel selling boyfriend. We should all be so lucky... is he the one for Mary? or the one that gets away?   I rate this as a 8 because it isn't a great moment of film history, it is not a classic, and it is not great art (all of which get deeper and richer on re-viewing). Like ""Desperately Seeking Susan"" it represents something very true about it's time period, but may become irrelevant with time. Still, it has everything an entertaining film needs, and is worth viewing several times for the clothes alone!"
2,"Adam Sandler as Happy Gilmore brings laughs once again to the career of Adam Sandler. This movie is one of the movies Sandler started out with. Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore are both the two movies Adam Sandler started out with. Going Overboard was no professional movie at all. With Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore you have Happy Madison Productions. Happy Madison has done well good movies. They did the first Deuce Bigelow and they did Dickie Roberts Former Child Star. Adam has come from Saturday Night Live with all he knows and has acted with what he knows. David Spade, Chris Farley, Dana Carvey, Mike Myers, Ben Stiller, Steve Martin, and Bill Murray are the other men who have done well after Saturday Night Live. Adam Sandler still has a great career ahead of him."
2,"I love foreign movies from all over the world. But this movie from Thailand nearly made me to hate movies from Thailand the way I hate Hollywoood movies. But, I will not, I will continue to watch movies from Thailand and I will even give it a try and watch another movie from Weerasethakul.  At first, I thought to myself, how in the heck did such a movie even win an award. This movie looked like some amateur movie made by some amateur director. I had to research this director and found out that he is a respectable person in the world of artistic movies. I was really disappointed, that somebody of his caliber could make a movie this horrible. There is no story, nothing, nada. What was he trying to tell us? The only redeeming aspect of this movie is cinematography, the landscapes are beautiful and the scene where the couple are having a picnic is breathtaking. Also the scene at the river is amazing. That is the only good thing I saw in the movie. The movie lacked passion, no emotion. Even the stupid sex scenes were virtually empty, at least you'd expect people to show some emotion here. But, NO! nothing! To add insult to injury, the movie dragged on for a good 2 hours! I just wish the people who awarded this awful movie could just explain to me what they found award-worthy. Maybe I missed it, I am no expert in movie making and all BUT I know a good movie when I see one, and Blissfully Yours is NOT one of them.  NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!!!"
2,"This movie is complete waste of time. Yup. Why? Oh, boy, where should I start? Bad acting? Lousy screenplay? Fact that movie is to late?   Emir Hadziwhateverhisnameisić hated this role, he admitted it in some news interview, and that can be easily seen trough this entire move. I even felt sorry for him seeing how much he suffers acting in this movie. I doubt he faked his drinking... He is talented actor, but not even his talent couldn't make him even to try to act. I don't blame him. Sergej Trifunović is giving his best. Which means that he suck. Yup, Emir at least has talent, this poor sob doesn't... Only possible explanation why would anyone even consider him for (any) role is fact that he look like what other ex-YU nations see as a stereotypical Serb. Funny enough, Serbs see him as stereotypical Albanian... Toni Gojanović... is chosen for this role simply because he's Croat... Croatia have much better actors than him (is he an actor at all?), but he does seems to be trying, and since he's a ""newb"", we can look trough his fingers...  Now, take a better look... Bosniak, Serb and Croat... and voilà, you have a generic ex-YU wannabe comedy... and that's it. It tries to look at war and reasons for war trough comedy but it just fail... there is no deep background story, there is no secret agendas, there is no comedy there is no nothing.. Movie was heavily advertised here as ""Movie that put together Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks in hilarious comedy"" and people wanted to see trough Karaula their youths and lives in pre-1991. Yugoslavia, but most of them abandoned theater before end because they have found foreign country and foreign army with foreign people and foreign stories. Something they didn't wanted or cared to see. Macedonia is foreign to Serbs, YPA is foreign to Serbs, Bosniaks and Croats are foreign to Serbs. Famous scene at the end of movie where actors get out on stage and public isn't tapping is clear sign what public thinks about this movie.   I thought that pathetic ex-YU ethnic humor has died in 1991. And it did. This is just zombiefied version if it, and it's not funny. It's sad. Strange thing I find is the fact that only in Serbia this movie was advertised like this is 1975, like we all live in perfect ""brotherhood and unity"" and that war never happened. Film had financial success in all countries of former YU, except in Serbia, despite big advertising campaign. Movie entered trough big doors, but it exited through back door, quietly and shamefully. This movie is wanting to look back at last moments of Yugoslavia, it is trying to say to us that it's not our fault, that we all were seduced by ""drunken and selfish"" leaders, blah, blah, blah... It could make some point if it was released during 1995; 1996; or 1997; considering that war and Yugoslavia were still ""fresh"" and all... but in 2006, this movie just doesn't make sense...   Legacy of this movie is big. Yup, before this movie, many various EX-YU actors and directors were talking about making some new movies as homage to old partisan films... luckily, this movie showed that it would be just waste of money...  I want my 94 minutes back."
2,"I love this movie, like most norwegians. Still after all these years watching this movie again and again I still can barely believe it's norwegian! It's just TOO good to be true! Without a doubt one the greatest animated movies in the international history of movies! Too bad it contains so many internal references to norwegian characters and surroundings as these jokes then will be somewhat lost to foreigners, but there's still lots and lots left. This also has my favorite movie-line ever: ""Jasså, døk sitt og glor?"" :) (it looses a lot when translated)  It was sooo sad when Ivo Caprino died, who created this. Maybe, just maybe his son will be crazy enough to make a sequel 30 years later??? I wish!"
2,"This is simply one more extremely bad vampire flick that occupies space in the ""Horror"" section of video stores. The notion of ""plot"" barely even punctures this movie. But Dennis Miller is, well, Dennis Miller. It is only because of him that I rented the movie, and only because of his wry, sarcastic comments that I finished watching it. If you're a Dennis Miller fan, then perhaps you should see Bordello of Blood. But don't rent it for its horror value--there is none."
2,"Before M. Night Shamaylan started making horribly inadequate movies after the superior ""Sixth Sense"" Tobe Hooper twenty years earlier was following up his cult masterpiece ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" with the dull and moronic ""Eaten Alive"". Neville Brand is Judd a mentally unstable owner of one of the most uninviting hotels on Earth. Why anyone of sound mind would want to stay here is beyond me. The soundstage it was filmed on doesn't help with its constant red horizon surrounding the place. None the less wary travelers attempt to brave the night there and are treated to being either skewered with a scythe, witch is a very inefficient murder weapon of choice personally, fed to Judd's pet crocodile or, just for the ladies, beaten and tied up. Why Judd does all this is never addressed as it seems everyone with a pulse draws his ire. I would assume that some of his guests had to live beforehand otherwise he wouldn't be in business very long. It is impossible to watch this without comparing this to Texas Chainsaw Massacre and realizing how woefully inept this is as a follow-up film. The scary thing about Leatherface is the fact that you can tell that this grotesque lifestyle is all he knows and will ever know. Judd comes off as a cranky old man very much in need of a nap. The cast is forgettable as Mel Ferrer stars in his first of two movies titled ""Eaten Alive"" and Robert Englund makes his film debut as Buck who like to fu......fornicate. I've had scarier nights at a Holiday Inn."
2,"Arguably the magnum opus of the silent screen. It must seen to be believed! One can only wonder what the film would have been like had it been made a few later, after the advent of sound. Would appreciate any information regarding the original score. The version we saw on TCM has what seems to be a new soundtrack"
2,"OK so the story line is different but the characters are cliché and the actors are appalling. Especially the lead actor (Kristine Blackport), she thinks too highly of her acting abilities and you can definitely tell! I'm really surprised that she is the lead actress in this movie, I mean it has independent written all over it, but still she is atrocious, many of the extras could probably have done the role/movie more justice. The music also doesn't help at all, it's annoying at best. The only thing that made this movie watchable was definitely the cinematography! It was artful and flowing and did the most towards helping understand what was going on, although the scene changes were a little jumpy, visually this film was great! Acting-wise it was beyond poor!"
2,"An erotic love story.  Big Joe used his usual plot devices here.  Prostitution ring disguised as a modeling agency services wealthy clients of all types. I couldn't tell if this was filmed in the U.S. or Europe. But wherever it was filmed, it looked great.  Seeing Mark Shannon play a cowboy was actually funny. But do cowboys really call every woman they meet 'filly?'   Laura (Goddess Supreme) Gemser matures in her roles and actually plays the boss of women instead of just a rebel. I hated the fact that she cut her hair. She looked better with it loooooooong. She's still a Goddess however.  The sub-plot about the young lad dealing with potential homosexuality was a tad weird.  But the lass in the lead looked GREAT. Her massage scene with the Turk left me gasping."
0,"Seeing all of the negative reviews for this movie, I figured that it could be yet another comic masterpiece that wasn't quite meant to be. I watched the first two fight scenes, listening to the generic dialogue delivered awfully by Lungren, and all of the other thrown-in Oriental actors, and I found the movie so awful that it was funny. Then Brandon Lee enters the story and the one-liners start flying, the plot falls apart, the script writers start drinking and the movie wears out it's welcome, as it turns into the worst action movie EVER.  Lungren beats out his previous efforts in ""The Punisher"" and others, as well as all of Van Damme's movies, Seagal's movies, and Stallone's non-Rocky movies, for this distinct honor. This movie has the absolute worst acting (check out Tia Carrere's face when she is in any scene with Dolph, that's worth a laugh), with the worst dialogue ever (Brandon Lee's comment about little Dolph is the worst line ever in a film), and the worst outfit in a film (Dolph in full Japanese attire). Picture ""Tango and Cash"" with worse acting, meets ""Commando,"" meets ""Friday the 13th"" (because of the senseless nudity and Lungren's performance is very Jason Voorhees-like), in an hour and fifteen minute joke of a movie.  The good (how about not awful) performances go to the bad guy (who still looks constipated through his entire performance) and Carrere (who somehow says her 5 lines without breaking out laughing). Brandon Lee is just there being Lungren's sidekick, and doing a really awful job at that.  An awful, awful movie. Fear it and avoid it. If you do watch it though, ask yourself why the underwater shots are twice as clear as most non-underwater shots. Speaking of the underwater shots, check out the lame water fight scene with the worst fight-scene-ending ever. This movie has every version of a bad fight scene for those with short attention spans and to fill-in between the flashes of nudity.  A BAD BAD MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"""A ship disappears during an ocean voyage and everyone is presumed lost. When evidence points towards a survivor of the wreck, the sailor's mother organizes an expedition to locate her missing son. When the explorers find the missing man living on n island, they take him against his will in order to return him to his home. The consequences of their actions prove very costly for the explorers, when the sailor sets about their downfall for taking him away from his island paradise,"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.  This ""edited version of a ten-year-old film, 'The Sea Fiend' (1936)"" is a curious choice for re-release. Perhaps, its generous footage of topless South Sea island native women was the alluring ingredient. Since they were animalistic ""natives"", they could be shown bare-chested. Non-native women, similarly displayed, would be considered pornographic. So, you have a big-screen movie turning the pages of the ""National Geographic"", while attempting to tell an adventure story. And, it's not even the original film.  * Devil Monster (1946) S. Edwin Graham ~ Barry Norton, Jack Del Rio, Terry Grey"
2,"Troll 2, Quickie Review (Edited from original review) This film is rated as one of the worst movies ever made on IMDb.com, and you know what? It got that rating for a damn good reason. ***SOME SPOILERS IN THIS ONE, BUT THEY WON'T HURT THIS FILM*** The movie follows a family that, for no apparent reason, is just ""switching homes"" with some hicks in some podunk town called ""Nilbog"" for a vacation. If that concept isn't weird enough, don't worry, the movie will quickly outshine that wet spot. Well, the town is infested with--you guessed it--goblins. What's that? You guessed trolls? Ha ha, sorry sucker, this movie is titled wrong--probably just to throw you off!! In fact, as the horrible little boy in the movie suffers the line, ""Nil-bog isss Gob-lin... back-waa-ards!!"" you begin to realize this the movie has a wealth of increasing crappiness yet to vomit your way. The goblins are immensely laughable, if not downright pathetic--they're midgets (oh, I'm sorry, not-tall people) dressed in what appear to be fire-damaged carpet with masks apparently crafted by the artful hands of Helen Keller. One of them has eyes the size of golf balls--and they never blink! On top of it, the ""goblins"" are vegetarians, so of course, in order to eat the visiting humans (in case you haven't guessed, the whole town is goblin-infested, like in ""The Howling,"" but crappy), they--get ready--turn them into vegetables of some sort. The acting is gut-wrenchingly bad--the worst is the woman playing the Mom in the family, there is no atmosphere--it takes place under the terror of daylight, and well, there is but one entertaining thing in the whole movie: That classic scene where, haunted by the ghost of grandpa, the little boy pisses all over the family's dinner to prevent them from eating food that would vegetate them into Goblin-meal. No kidding. 1/10  www.ResidentHazard.com"
1,"Probably the most whimsical installment of the first season, 'Shore Leave' has its ups and downs; some parts drag on too long and others are unambitiously cut short, but one can't deny they threw in everything but the proverbial kitchen sink to make this an entertaining episode. Kirk and crew seem to have found the perfect planet for shore leave after an extended tour of duty has left everyone on board in need of rest, relaxation and so on. It appears for all intents and purposes to be an uninhabited Earth, with beautiful scenery and an ideal climate. The first indication that things might go just a little awry is when McCoy, leading an advance team, spots Alice (from Wonderland) following a large white rabbit wearing a vest. Kirk beams down and finds the others reporting similarly bizarre happenings and encounters. The one thing they all have in common is that each crew member was thinking about the person/place/thing they discovered right before they discovered it. This doesn't immediately sink in with Kirk or anyone else. More strangeness ensues, including sightings of Don Juan, a Siberian tiger, a WW2 fighter plane, etc; Kirk meets up with Ruth, a gorgeous old girlfriend (of course) and a bully from his Academy days, Finnegan. The chase/fight scene with Finnegan goes on too long but at the same time, McCoy is run through with a lance by a knight on horseback and apparently killed. Finally, an elderly man appears and explains what has been happening. The planet is a futuristic 'amusement park' where visitors have only to imagine something to have it appear. Nothing is permanent; McCoy isn't really dead. Once this is explained, Kirk decides to order shore leave for everyone after all. Despite the 'it was all a dream' sort of ending, 'Shore Leave' holds up as another first-rate episode of Star Trek's first season."
2,"This film started out with a humorous, well-written screenplay that had potential, but this was wasted by the incompetent direction of its writer, Jordan Hawley. This film is Hawley's directorial debut and it couldn't be a better illustration of his complete lack of directorial confidence, creativity, or thoughtfulness. The dialogue is delivered in a forced, emotionally false way. There are many comedic cheap shots and the humor has a needlessly mean spirit. On a technical note, the cinematography is pretty good with some vibrant colors and a few of the supporting performances, notably Fred Willard's, are funny. However, the film panders to the lowest common denominator and follows a predictable formula. Despite its low- budget, this film has none of the wit and edge you would expect of an indie. It is ""mainstream comedy"" in the worst sense of the term."
2,"!!!! SPOILERS !!!!  First things first , I doubt very much there`s any truth in this "" True story "" Producer of SAVIOR Oliver Stone also wrote the screenplay of MIDNIGHT EXPRESS and unlike the account of Billy Hayes book the film version is a work of complete fiction . Let`s see Joshua Rose wife and child are murdered by Islamic terrorists so he shoots up a mosque . Can any tell me when this incident happened ? because I don`t recall any news reports about it . And why did Peter join the legion ? Surely he acted in self defence ? It also seems strange that the Croat defence council ( HVO ) decided to drive their Serb and Muslim victims right beside Joshua`s hiding place to be massacared .  Despite this criticism SAVIOR is a good film . I remember disliking it first time I saw it because I`d written an unproduced screenplay set during the Balkans conflict called SOLITUDE which plays out totally different from SAVIOR even though my screenplay also involves western mercs and also having a subtext that there`s no good guys in the Bosnian conflict . Jealousy aside ( I had my heart on SOLITUDE winning the best original screenplay Oscar ) I do admire SAVIOR for being an intelligent , sad and haunting film . Despite having Oliver Stone as producer and an American star this is a totally European film in both feel and execution "" I had a son . He`s dead . He had a son . He`s dead too . Both died fighting - For what ? "" a Croat tells Joshua . What indeed  I wouldn`t say this is the best Bosnian conflict movie ( That accolade goes to PRETTY VILLAGE PRETTY FLAME ) but it`s probably the most accesible to a western audience . War is obscene and when you compare this movie to BEHIND ENEMY LINES you can`t help thinking that Hollywood is even more of an obscenity the way it portrays the Balkans conflict  Peace out  "
0,"This was one film i wanted to watch always when it released The promos were eye catching and Govinda in a negative role was a surprise  But the film isn't that good  It has lot of flaws  The start is good and till the murder everything goes well but the film falls flat when the romance track starts between Govinda and Karisma and the songs that follow  Then the twist about Govinda and Tabu being in love leaves more doubts and flaws and then How come Govinda turns into a rich criminal from a poor villager?  The last flashback too is prolonged and also the entire clash between Govinda-Karisma and Tabu  N Chandra disappoints Music is okay, Bahot Khoobsurat stands out  Govinda tries a negative role and does very well in it though he overdoes it too much at times Karisma is good but irritates at times with her cries Tabu is okay Nirmal Pandey still doesn't know the difference between loud screaming and acting rest are okay"
2,"Robbie Williams said he grew up listening to this music and it has always been his dream to perform, and what better place to perform these songs then in the Albert Hall. This is a great tribute to the Rat Pack (Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin) and Robbie shows us is amazing voice along with a style of music which hasn't been seen from him before. I definetly recommend this to anyone (you can buy it on DVD or VHS) even if your not a Sinatra fan, you'll still love it 10/10"
2,"This is a poor and bizarre Sherlock Holmes movie. It's poor because the story has very little to do with the original Conan Doyle story. Heck, they even included a bunch of characters that weren't in this tale! It's bizarre because Reginald Owen seemed a very odd choice for the lead--seeming much more suited to the role of Watson than Holmes. Much of this is just tradition--actors famous for playing this same role repeatedly were William Gillette, Arthur Wontner, Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett were all thin guys and bore some similarity to each other. Owen just looked nothing like them and this took some getting used to. This isn't a bad thing--just an odd thing.  Also, I am really confused by the film because although it bears almost no similarity to ""A Study in Scarlet"", the film is very similar to Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None"" (a.k.a. ""The 10 Little Indians"" and another title which I can't use because I doubt if IMDb would allow me to use the original title due to political correctness). However, Christie's novel did not appear until the late 1930s, so it appears that perhaps she lifted the plot from this 1933 film or at least was strongly inspired by it. I am really surprised there wasn't a lot of uproar about the similarities.  If you ignore all these aspects, you still have a poor film because the film had such poor production values. There was no incidental music, lousy dialog, the acting was often VERY poor and the whole thing simply had no energy. As a result, instead of being engaging, the whole thing was mind-numbingly dull and I can't recommend you see it."
2,"'Jaws' wasn't even around to rip off yet, so what was the rationale for this uber-silly retribution-of-nature allegory? We keep cutting to the same stock shots of frogs doing their best to look menacing, but the best they can do is hop up and down on Ray Milland AFTER he bites it. Of course, in the meantime they also send psychic messages to their buddies in the lizard kingdom - snakes can always wreak some havoc as can spiders, big lizards are well equipped to knock stuff over, and those turtles are more deadly than they look! As are Sam Elliott's bare-chested nature photographer/idealist/rhetorician, a pre-surgical Joan Van Ark, and a couple of African-American servants who eventually get to enact the new spirit of civil rights on evil old moneyed cripple Milland. AIP strikes again."
2,"The film is a complete mess. The premise might be sort of interesting, but the already everything but clever script that has written ""novices at work!"" on every single page additionally gets messed up by a directing that gives a new quality to the word ""confusing"". And if that wasn't enough, it seems the material was edited by someone on LSD, otherwise there's no explanation for this... hmmm... montage. Putting the footage into a shredder would have shown better results. My regards to the actors who tried hard to put some life into this.  Producers listen up: little money is no excuse for bad craftsmanship!!!!"
1,"Heh, if I tell you to compare The Dark Knight with some 18-years-old comics-adapted movie rated 5.9, will you call me crazy? That's just to catch your attention. Everyday I meet people complaining there are no good movies, who seem to only know the recent blockbusters. It's never a bad thing to search and explore old movies, especially those with good artistic values. Dick Tracy is one of those can't be easily outdated, in terms of technology.  The negative reviews mainly complained about DT's ""messed up"" story. But it appears to me that the storyline is quite clear, and I had no problem following it. I didn't see the comic books, yet I am not a huge US comic fan, but I appreciate the top-notch film-making and performances. Maybe the expectations of most people were too high about the story it would tell. But, if you see a movie casting Madonna and Warren Beatty together, what would you expect. I had some scratches on my head, and can't help but wonder, did we really see the same movie? The title role, although not as competent as it sounds, still was able to pull him up and charm the audiences. Madonna was more express-less than ""breathless"" in her seductive role, but added a lot of fun to the story. Al Pacino was funny and prodigy to himself. Apparently he's bold enough to go sarcastic on his previously successful roles. We can see a hybrid of Scarface, Michael Corleone, Adolf Hitler and Robert De Niro punching our stomaches to make us laugh. And many thanks to make-ups.  To me it's not bad at all. The surreal feeling really got me."
0,"I found a DVD of ""I Dream Of Jeanie"" in the $1.00 bin at Wal-Mart. When I saw that it was the ""story of Stephen Foster"", being a musician and music educator, I had to see it. I had no idea what year it was made for it did not say on the cover, just that it was a remake of 1939's ""Sewanee River"". Bill Shirley's portrayal of the composer is sometimes painful, sometimes laughable. The man has NO testosterone and is a wimp all the way through! I have a difficult time believing Stephen Foster thought music publishers were doing him a favor by publishing his songs...without paying him for them! In addition to that ridiculous notion, there is a nearly 20 minute segment of Ray Middleton and his black-faced ""Christy Minstrels"" performing Stephen Foster's songs that was difficult to watch, to say the least. I can hardly believe anyone would consider this movie appropriate to resurrect in our current time. It is an embarrassment and should remain forgotten. Fortunately, Stephen Foster's songs will NEVER be forgotten....also, Eileen Christy's portrayal of Jeanie was certainly the highest point in this lowest point of Hollywood history."
2,"Having just watched The Bronze Buckaroo, I picked the next film on the ""Black Westerns"" disc of the DVD set ""Black Entertainment in Film"" which happened to be Harlem Rides the Range. Once again Herb Jeffries stars as Bob Blake with Lucius Brooks as sidekick Dusty and Clarence Brooks in a villainous role. Spencer Williams, however, is on the good side this time as Blake's ranch-hand boss and previously female lead Artie Young is just a picture here until the last 10 min. Also F. E. Miller appears again as Slim Perkins who with Lucius provides some amusing comic relief that in a white cast movie might have been considered racist. I actually thought Harlem Rides the Range might have been slightly duller than The Bronz Buckaroo but at least this time the print was good and the soundtrack was clear so I could actually hear the dialogue well and the singing was more enjoyable as a result which was provided by Mr. Jeffries and The Four Tones of which Lucius is a member. P. S. Another player, Wade Dumas who was the Dog City Sheriff, came from my home state of Louisiana in addition to Mr. Williams. Also, Mr. Williams and Mr. Miller wrote the screenplay this time."
0,"Well.......in contrast to other comments previously written I have to say that the only good thing about this film is the fact that one guy in it looked a bit like Jason Donavon which reminded me of my youth. I have no idea how it won any awards, and although I'm sure a great deal of effort went into making it it was all fruitless as the final outcome is one which screams of early 90's foreign soap operas. The plot was non-existent, the cinematography was hopeless and the acting was on par with an a-level performance. It was unfortunately long and the sub-plots were incredibly unrealistic....for example....if your best friend slept with your ex-boyfriend of 6 years after only 2 weeks of being broken up you would not all remain the best of friends. It was all fantasy. That's all! Oh yeah, and the weird 90's house/soft core indie was mind numbing!"
2,"Just this morning, as I was flicking absent-mindedly through the television channels, I accidentally clicked my way onto Channel 31 (Australia), which, I hazard to venture, is not generally known for its quality programming. Luckily, my eye was momentarily caught by a young and sharp-looking Cary Grant, and I immediately identified the film to be 1940's 'His Girl Friday,' which I had been meaning to watch for some months. Just like Frank Capra's holiday favourite 'It's A Wonderful Life,' the film has fallen into the public domain, and so television stations are completely free to air it whenever they want. This also means that any company is allowed to throw a poor-quality print onto DVD at practically no cost to them, so this is something to be wary of. Unfortunately, I missed a few minutes of the beginning of the film, but I was too hooked into the story to worry about that until later.  For his remake of the 1931 film 'The Front Page' (which was directed by Lewis Milestone and starred Adolphe Menjou), Howard Hawks took the story  complete with all its witty, rapid-fire dialogue  and changed the male character of Hildebrand 'Hildy' Johnson to a female  Hildegaard 'Hildy' Johnson (Rosalind Russell)  and also the ex-wife of the newspaper editor, Walter Burns (Cary Grant). When Hildy expresses her intentions of quitting the newspaper business and marrying Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy) in Albany, Walter takes every precaution possible to prevent her from boarding that train. With a convicted cop-killer, Earl Williams (John Qualen), set to be hanged in the morning, the press-room at the prison is abuzz with vulturous reporters scavenging about for a good story. Rather than simply admitting his continuing love for Hildy, Walter uses the great lengths to which he will go to stop her leaving to tell her how he still feels about her. Also, along the way, Hildy discovers  as the night gradually becomes more and more exciting  that she is a reporter at heart, and will never be able to rid herself of the desire to uncover that perfect story.  The jokes come thick and fast, with the talented cast delivering the clever dialogue faster than you can register it, barely giving you any time to laugh. Especially in screwball comedies such as these, actor confidence is absolutely essential, and everybody involved here performs admirably. In addition to the entertaining and often-heated banter between Walter and Hildy, other excellent characters include Bruce Baldwin (the unfortunate would-be future husband whose is arrested on no less than three occasions, and whose mother is kidnapped), the bumbling Sheriff Peter B. Hartwell (Gene Lockhart), Walter's sneaky henchman, Diamond Louie (Abner Biberman), the governor's clueless delivery-man, Joe Pettibone (Billy Gilbert) and a long line of newspaper reporters, each of whom witnesses the same event and yet still reports it in a completely different and entirely inaccurate manner."
2,"A boy with telekinetic powers, and perhaps other psychic abilities as well as bowl-cut hair lives with his divorced father, a psychic researcher or something. The boy plays in his closet with a He-Man-like action figure, and a odd statuette he calls ""Deceptor."" His father hears a strange moan, makes an odd phone call to his research partner, and goes upstairs to the boy's room with a machete. He goes into the closet, vandalizes some things, and is in search of something. The machete moves by itself, and the father falls on it, decapitating himself.  The boy goes to live with his mother and her boyfriend. Meanwhile, a police detective who has sleeping problems has a reoccurring nightmare that is bothering him on the job, and is forced to see a shrink. More closet-related bizarre deaths occur. The detective befriends the boy, and the shrink helps him on the case.  The special effects are pretty uneven. The death scenes are fairly good. A pale grinning figure in the closet is pretty spooky. Dead people who reappear as zombies or as a demon appearing like them are pretty well done. The demon exerts its power by psychically dragging someone up a wall, and across a ceiling towards an out-of-control ceiling fan. The demon itself is pretty darn lame, however."
2,"The Endless Waltz, a fine piece of anime at it's best. Heero's human side has shown him to be a very virtous and honorable fighter. His own personal struggle has greatly been an intricate part of this movie. We get to see a forming romantic bond between Relena and Heero as well. Mariemaya Krushrenada was a victim of greed in this movie, and a pawn in a bigger scheme planned by her sick, sedistic, madman she calls Grandfather (Dekim Barton). Spectacular Animation! Awesome storyline! A must see for any anime fan!!!!!"
1,"As someone who has lived with cerebral palsey for over forty years, I find this movie to be inspirational. If someone with such a severe case of CP as Christie Brown has can do so much, then there's no reason that I couldn't achieve my own dreams. Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker both give awesome performances.  "
2,"This little movie was a total delight. It had a great story line, was well acted and had a strong message while being poignant and humorous. The story of a 5th grader at an all boys Catholic school on a mission to find God is extremely funny, witty and compelling at the same time. This movie will make you run the gamut of emotions; you'll laugh, cry and at the end be satisfied that yes, there is indeed a God. Joshua's mission includes his discovery of life around him and for the first time he notices the wherefore's and why's of his family, friends and life in general. I found this movie to be very moving, so much so that I bought the DVD and am passing it around to friends and family. I give it my highest recommendation and know anyone who watches it won't be disappointed."

In one scene David Warbeck ask some character ""have you seen any worse actors?"". -And I can only give him a honest ""No!"" A very slow going film with few values."
2,"I use to be a big fan of Michael Moore in his early documentary days. He has now turned into a Socialist nut case. So nothing has happened good in the eight years of the Bush administration? Nothing!?!?!? For a man that flies first class on his trips, America has worked out nice for him.  How could anyone vote for a party that wants to ""Spread the wealth around""  If everyone had to wake up at 6 in the morning and put in 8 hours of work, let's go ""Spread the wealth around"" When I and maybe 30 million people like I go to work on a Friday that has to hold up this economy, while a majority of the rest of the country sits on their butts and does nothing and has more children. Yeah, America is pretty fair, play by the rules and you get screwed.  Hey Michael, put down the taco too."
2,"The only reason this dreadful version of a much loved book even garnered a four from me is because the scenery itself was beautiful, and the actual Orchard House where the Alcotts lived was incorporated into the filming.  This in no way touches on the depth of character from Louisa May Alcott's book, in fact it's so bad that when certain important events occur...don't want to give anything away here concerning the plot...one is left wondering why they should care. The acting itself was wooden--Winona Ryder makes a horrible Jo, and Claire Danes as Beth was truly pitiful--the script did not flow or introduce any of the wonderful aspects of character that was found in the book, or the movie version starring Margaret O'Brien, Elizabeth Taylor, and June Allyson. Watching this film, one does not know that Meg pines away for riches because the family used to be wealthy, and she has never forgotten having the ""little luxuries."" One does not know that Beth spent a great deal of her time next door at the Lawrence's and was such a beautiful piano player. They don't even introduce the fact that Amy is ""ashamed"" of her nose, which was most amusing. And Jo, it's miserable the way they butchered her character. Instead of holding her head high above her sorrows and troubles, this film portrayed her as a ""oh-woe-is-me"" type of character who just felt sorry for herself.  Please don't waste your time on this. If you wish to see Little Women in film, rent or buy a different version. The version with June Allyson was infinitely better than this one. Or better yet, spend some time and read the book."
2,"I had the misfortune of watching this movie while I was serving a mission for the LDS Church. Contrary to the comment by Kolob, this movie was neither historically accurate, nor entertaining. The cinematography was crap, the editing was crap, the acting was crap. Please do not accept this trash as any accurate representation of the great men that Brigham Young and Joseph Smith were. It is certainly a discredit to their memories for something like this film to be made. Coincidentally, this same movie was edited a bit, then changed to ""made for TV"" under the title ""Savage Journey."" That movie (because it is the same movie) is also a blatant work of nonsense. Nice try though. The only semblance this movie has to actual historical fact is that, yes, Brigham Young did have a beard."
1,"Fantastic movie. One to excite all 5 senses. Is not a true historical report and not all information is to be taken as factual information. True Hollywood conventions used, like playing A list and VERY attractive actors as the 'heroes', such as Naomi Watts (Julia Cook - Ned Kelly's lover), Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Byrne - Ned's right hand man), and unattractive (sorry Geoffrey Rush) actors play the drunken and corrupt Victorian Police Force. This also instills a very unreliable love story into the mix between Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts) to entice all the romantics, females being especially susceptible. Even from the first scene, when Ned saves the fat youth from drowning and his dad calls him ""sunshine"" and had a ""glint in his eye as he looked down at me, his hand on me shoulder,"" it is very romanticized and persuades viewers to side with Ned Kelly, the underdog. Besides, don't all Aussies love an underdog?"
1,This was another great Tom Berenger movie.. But some people are right it was like another SGT BARNES character but it was still awsome.. Tom Berenger played a great sniper in the jungles Of Panama! Billy Zane was a wuss at first just like Cpl Upham from Saving Private Ryan but then he got a little more aggresive in the end! Sniper was awsome and action buffs should watch it.. I remind you it wouldnt have as much action as a reg action flick.. i got this one on DVD too and it is excellent!
0,"A disappointing end to a season that started so well ...  Exodus part 2 and other notable episodes were amongst the best seen on TV in any series, where as this was rather bad.  Well I am not sure if it was the episode that was a disappointment, but the cheesy guitar music at that accompanied the closing sequence was laughable and would have been more at home in the original series.  Its almost as if the corporate execs didn't like the low key down note ending and wanted to jazz it up. They failed and rather spoilt everything.  Lets hope this is not a trend for the future.  Still at least we saw the return of a certain person even if somewhat bizarrely and tritely done."
2,"Although I am a US history teacher, I'd never heard about James Reavis and his claim to be the Baron of Arizonia (most of modern Arizona). So I was fascinated to see a film about this huckster who had the audacity to try to claim this huge chunk of territory as his own private land in the late 19th century. So fascinated that I did a bit of research on Reavis after I finished the movie.  It seems that when the US got this land from Mexico, it promised to honor all existing land grants. Reavis, a talented forget and swindler, concocted a complicated scheme to take this land--a claim that ALMOST worked!   The film stars Vincent Price in one of his earlier starring roles. While he'd been in Hollywood for about a decade, most of the time he was relegated to supporting roles. Here in THE BARON OF ARIZONA, he was clearly the star and the film benefited from his fine acting. However, you may be surprised to see Price acting a bit more like an action hero at times in the film, as he is much more macho than his usual persona--occasionally resorting to kicking the snot out of his enemies!  The film was one of the earliest directorial efforts of the legendary Sam Fuller. While I didn't like how the story was fast and loose with the real facts of the case, Fuller must be commended for making such a professional looking film with only 15 days shooting!! Usually such a quickly made film would be a cheap horror film along the lines of an Ed Wood movie, but this one has all the polish of an A-picture.  As for the plot, despite the facts that so much of the script is wrong, it still is a very captivating movie and at least it captures the essence of who Reavis was--even though the details are more than a little wrong. This playing fast and loose with details is fairly common in Hollywood films of the era, so I don't hold this against the film that much.  Overall, the film is fascinating, tough to stop watching and a quality production throughout most of the film. However, despite Fuller's reputation for not being a sentimentalist, the last 15 minutes of the film are indeed heavy on sentiment and actually is about the worst part of the film. Plus, in reality Reavis only got a 2 year sentence (not 6) and his wife did indeed leave him--and the way the film ended and how he was caught is pure fiction.  For a much more correct version of the real case, see http://jeff.scott.tripod.com/baron.html . It has a link to a very exhaustive site by Michael Marinacci. Oddly, the true facts of the case are in many ways much more interesting than this film!!"
2,"Following up to the first Jedi Knight was not going to be easy. It had it all, and it was all very accomplished. This does an amazing job, even if it doesn't reach it all the way(what could?). The plot is pretty good, if perhaps not the *most* original ever, and it features something of an inconsistency(another reviewer comments on this, too) with Star Wars canon. There are many different areas in the SW universe, all rather nicely done. Level design/LOD are great, if not quite as expertly done as that of the first, but there are definitely some marvelous things to be found... these include switches and such that you activate with your Force Powers, a vehicle or two(not spoiling the surprise in this review), and more. Difficulty settings are fairly well-done, if parts of the game seem overly challenging regardless of which you play on. The boss enemies are fun, for one immediately obvious reason, but the explanation behind them(and thus, how compelling a presence they are) just doesn't measure up to that of the first... even if there are far, far more of them. Graphics(the engine is a modified version of that of Quake III) are absolutely *gorgeous*. Blaster fire, the levels, the *Lightsabers*... oh my. This helps make the fact that the cut-scenes are now(as opposed to the live-action of the first) almost entirely engine-based(supplemented with a handful of CGI-sequences) easier to accept, as does the reasonable cinematography and range of animations, and the flawless programming of both. AI is magnificent, enemies behave realistically throughout, if the range could have been better. Sound and music are excellent, throughout, wide range of both and the quality is top-notch all the way. The game-play is entertaining, and that is an(but not the only one) aspect where this really lives up to the first(and at times surpasses it... although there are parts of this that are surpassed by the first). Both as a straight FPS and as third-person-action, the game is an *enormously* fun time in the SW galaxy. The Single Player portion is of adequate length, and is of high quality throughout, nothing seems tacked on. Almost everything in the game is fully developed. The Lightsaber is almost perfect. The power of it, the deflection... in this game, their appearance closer resemble those of the new trilogy of films, at least in part due to the release of the first of them having been to the theaters when they were making it. The swings are also far more effective and fast(again, with the release of Episode 1). I'm still not a fan of the throwing(and it gets to be downright common, here), but they kind of had to have it, after it appeared in Mysteries of the Sith. This time around(in Single Player), more of the game passes before you get your saber, and, well, let's just say, it wasn't by accident the demo(which is very much worth playing, by the way, and not just to see if you'll like the full game, either) had you starting out with it(although the level where you get it is... worth fighting your way to). The saber duelling... that's a tough one. Allow me to make a deduction, based on what I've seen of it in games(which, admittedly, is not that much, but maybe there just isn't all that much of it)... fencing, sword-fighting, in games that aren't exclusively dedicated to it, has to somewhat decide between which it's going to be more of... freedom, fun and swift movements, or strategy, effectiveness and, to a degree, realism. The latter group is, for example, the first two Prince of Persia games, and both this and the third game(where the focus still laid largely laid in the second of the two categories) of that series attempt for a mix... in the case of both, the result is that you can hack and slash away effortlessly and, more by chance than anything else, take out boss enemies and other players. In this game, there is still an unmistakable requirement of skill, if nothing or nowhere else, then when you face multi-player foes that are superior, and possibly a boss enemy or two, as well. But it won't look like those scenes in the films. In every other case, the Lightsaber, and just about everything in the entire game, does look right, however. One or two things don't look exactly right, but that's it. The weapons are another success story. Unlike that of the first, where it was more or less of a sporadic nature which did and which didn't, here, *every* weapon has an alternate fire mode. Said secondary fire tends to be remarkably useful, too. Not all from the first game return, but I'm not sure there's a single FPS armory need that isn't covered. Nothing gets phoned in this. Multiplayer is... what can I say? 'Addictive' may be the word(and bot supported). In addition to the main ones(FFA, Team FFA and CTF), there are some interesting(and entertaining!) playing modes... Duel, Holocron FFA and Jedi Master. The first one is self-explanatory... saber fights, one on one, in kind of a tournament. The second is FFA, Free For All, but with all the Force Powers in Holocrons(cubes you can pick up) in the level, and every player starts without any. Last, but by no means least... Jedi Master. There's a Lightsaber at one point in the level. Pick it up, and you're Jedi Master. Full level of every Force Power, and the saber as your only weapon. Only the Master can earn points, and killing him releases the Jedi weapon of choice for other players to pick up. The Force Powers really rival said blade in joy-bringing... they're awesome, well-done, well-rounded, with little to no exception. They get more powerful as the game progresses, in set order and pace, but this works well. You also get to use both sides, in SP. I recommend this to fans of Star Wars, action games and FPS. 7/10"

2,"I find it hard to understand how viewers could be positive about this film, as I found it appalling. Film-makers should give up on Phillip Roth adaptations unless they can give them the necessary energy; and biting, incisive and vulgar insights that are so much a part of Roth's work. In stead in this film, like most of the other Roth adaptations, we get pretentious literary performances that mostly bore and frustrate.  I couldn't even make it through to the end, and I have a bookshelf of Phillip Roth books - and rate him as my favorite living American author.   Ultimately, I found this film a big disappointment and suggest you read the book rather than endure the film."
2,"I feel the need to post a comment on this title because I've seen a few comments from people who are surprised at the positive user response for such an awful show.  What is truly tragic about Andromeda is that it is a show that never realized its full potential. This is due to the powers that be and their decision to remove Wolfe from his post as head writer of the show.  From Season 1 to the halfway point of Season 2, Wolfe was the head writer of Andromeda and the show was quality in every sense of the word. Wolfe took his experience from shows such as Star Trek: Deep Space Night and invested it in Andromeda, bringing life to intricate plot-lines and vibrant characters functioning in a realized Universe.  As Season 2 began to move along, the usual first season clumsiness that one expects from new TV shows had totally dissolved and an epic plot line was beginning to come to life.  This was tragically cut short when Wolfe was fired. After this unfortunate event, nearly all of his work was thrown out of the window as the series took an entirely different direction in favour of mainstream approval and a more episodic format. The most painful example of the latter is embodied in the decision to do away with the character of Trance in favour of a new incarnation of the character designed to be sexy.  The series began to spiral downwards even more, until it was finally too difficult to watch. Andromeda soon began to buy into nearly every science fiction cliché in the book, and when it ended was a pathetic worm of its former glory.  Four stars out of ten for 1.5 excellent seasons and 3.5 awful ones in a show that tragically never met its unimaginable potential."
1,"Out of these Pokemon films (which are in order of best to least for me): Pokemon The First Movie, Pokemon 4Ever, Pokemon Heroes, Pokemon 200 and Pokemon: Entei and the Unknown, this is probably the one most concerning the environment, arguably the most beautiful and the most calming one. Whether these are good points for you or not, ""Pokemon 4Ever,"" still has entertained many.  As well as the three points covered above, this pokemon film includes good humour and good CGI (as well as anime). The time travelling theme of the film is represented in a good way and Team Rocket (the comic reliefs/rubbish baddies) end up with quite good gags and end up being more main characters than sidekicks.   The flaws are, as always, the rather unnecessary violence and action and the baddie is pretty uninteresting, even more so than a few Pokemon film baddies.   A strange pokemon is being tracked down by a pokemon hunter in a forest. A young boy tries to save the pokemon and it takes him somewhere...  Meanwhile, Ash, Brock and Misty are entering a large forest...  Curious? Watch the rest...  Good for all Pokemon fans and ""American"" anime movie fans, enjoy ""Pokemon 4Ever""! :-)"
2,"Director Joe Dante proudly wears his influences on his sleeve in this excellent Spielberg-produced demented comedy/horror about mischievous creatures that run riot in the sleepy town of Kingston Falls.  Referencing all of his favourite films and cartoons, including The Wizard of Oz (the film's villain is Oz's Mrs. Gulch in all but name), Looney Tunes (check out the sound effects Dante uses), Disney (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs features heavily in the story), and Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Joe has a blast allowing his toothy critters to (very amusingly) wreak havoc in typically Spielbergian small-town America.  Hoyt Axton plays Rand Peltzer, a less than successful inventor who buys his son Billy (Zach Galligan) a most unusual Christmas gift: a creature called a mogwai (which he names Gizmo). This impossibly cute bundle of fur comes with a strict set of rules which are inevitably broken. The result is a horde of vicious foot high monsters that set out to cause trouble wherever they can.  With the help of Gizmo, and gorgeous workmate Kate (the always stunning Phoebe Cates), Billy sets out to destroy the gremlins.  Although perhaps a bit too scary in places for more sensitive youngsters (the kitchen attack scene, in particular is quite frightening), Gremlins is great fun for monster movie addicts of all ages. My kidsaged four and sixlove this film (although I admit that I have been gradually conditioning them: one of the toys they have had from birth is a bendy Gremlin!). It really is hard to resist the movie's non-stop manic and zany comedy (the Gremlins are a hoot as they break-dance, get drunk, play poker, and sing Christmas carols!).  Sure, some moments are perhaps a little too daft (personally, I don't understand that rule about not feeding a mogwai after midnight, and I can't fully accept the scene where Gizmo drives a fully functioning Barbie car) but excellent animatronics courtesy of Chris Walas, a nifty script from Chris Columbus, loads of in-jokes for fans of fantasy films (look out for blink-and-you'll-miss-them appearances from Gremlins producer Steven Spielberg and animator Chuck Jones, an appearance from Forbidden Planet's Robbie the Robot, a stuffed ET toy sat between a cuddly Sylvester and Bugs Bunny, and the Time Machine from the 60s George Pal movie) all go to make Gremlins an unmissable treat.  And its got Phoebe Cates in it too! Which means it gets the full 10/10."
2,"Having seen the Project Greenlight series about the making of this film, I had very low expectations for the final product. The director was portrayed as amateurish, and his stubborn attempts to cast his unproven actress girlfriend in the movie seemed to support that charge.  In retrospect, it seems that the Weinsteins sacrificed any shot at successfully distributing this film theatrically in favor of exploiting it as TV fodder. A rare misfire from the usually brilliant media moguls. Had they been brave and supported this movie, they might have ended up with a mega-million dollar theatrical franchise like Nightmare on Elm Street, instead of a straight-to-vid release.  A classic B horror film, FEAST serves up heaping helpings of cheap thrills in lieu of long-winded ""back stories"" which thrill development girls and story editors but leave horror fans snoring in their popcorn. The character development is clever and perfunctory, introducing a dozen characters with minimal fuss and maximum efficiency--colorful characters worthy of a (good) Tarantino flick.  The script is fast-paced and the direction captures the tone of it perfectly. The real fun starts just a few minutes into the first act, and keeps on pumping throughout the film, with just enough lulls in the action to reset the audience for more.  The cast is superb all around, with luscious ladies and hunky guys playing it for all its worth. Thankfully, whatever humor there is is not the insipid one-liner crap or tedious reflexive humor that's dragged the genre down for the past twenty years.  The EFX are topnotch, and the cinematography is outstanding, giving the film a bigger budget feel and greatly enhancing the limited number of sets.  Although some may disagree with the lack of a ""back story"" of the monsters, they were no more mysterious than the creatures in ALIEN, another film in which there was no way for the protagonists to learn more about their foes without contrived and boring exposition.  I can't wait to check out John Gulager's other films, and hope he gets a chance to expand into bigger budgets which he deserves. I also hope he stays in horror and doesn't lose his edge, because there are far too few consistent directors in the genre."
2,"Superbly written and acted. I'm still thinking about this movie, 15 years later, after seeing it at a local art film movie house in Ann Arbor. The pastoral beauty of the Maine-like seaside isolation is beautifully and bleakly shot, and the location is a perfect choice for this reflective look at how we banish and bury the truth and emotional life. It's the ocean, the natural world, which keeps track of the past and the present, and does not let anyone forget. I give this film 10 votes out of 10 for vibrant use of Latin-American Magical Realism plus Best ""guys dancing with guys"" in a bar in Nowheresville scene ever. A quiet, thoughtful movie that precisely conveyed a different way of thinking about the world, and which changed a lot of the ways that I think about the world--exactly what the power of film was meant to accomplish."
2,"I finally brought myself to watch all of the Big Store, the movie on the flip side of Go West DVD. I recall seeing Store (in the late 60's/early 70's I deliberately saw any Marx movie whether on TV or in a revival in a theatre until I had seen them all) years before and being bored out of my skull.  I had tried to watch it a few weeks earlier, but gave up after the scene where the beds can be hidden in the wall or floors.  This time, biting the bullet, I watched Groucho sing while he sold and the final chase scene with sound effects added that made it seem like a Hanna-Barbera cartoon.  And the end, I had to admit, The Big Store was passable--provided it had starred someone else.  If you can erase the fact you're watching the Marx Brothers from your mind, The Big Store seems exactly like any overblown 1940's comedy. It well meets the standard for a Red Skelton film or perhaps something with Danny Kaye or early Jerry Lewis.  If you can perform the mental feat that Groucho is Red Skelton, Chico is Danny Kaye and Harpo is Jerry Lewis (uggghhh!), the Big Store does not seem like the abysmal thing it is.  Seeing this film makes you understand just how high the bar the Marx Brothers set for their movies, much higher than virtually any other comic working with a film studio, instead of independently as Chaplin did.  Things happened in a Marx Brother film that just never happened in one with Red Skelton: Margaret Dumont being deviled by Groucho, Groucho being deviled by Chico, and the rest of the Universe bedeviled by Harpo. Out of the gate in the Cocoanuts, the Brothers' first film in 1929, we already have the ""Why A Duck?"" routine between Groucho and Chico. We already have Groucho's ""Won't you lie down?"" to Margaret Dumont, and Harpo giving Basil Ruysdael his leg while whistling a tune from the arcane musical, ""Floradora."" Even as we move to the later films, there is also the Marx's brilliant sense of surrealism and absurdity, far beyond the capabilities of anyone else. Their penultimate film, A Night in Casablanca, an almost last hurrah which they financed themselves and had more say over, can be arguably ranked with the lesser Paramount or best MGM films.  But Store provides a disconnect which the brothers never are able to overcome. This was never something impossible for them. The plot was generally something they made their way around, jumped over, or totally jettisoned. Here, there are trapped in it, and it's not pretty.  There are still some marvelous moments--how can there not be in a Marx Brothers movie? Groucho's last film appearance with Margaret Dumont is as always wonderful. Harpo has a magnificent harp solo where he turns into Mozart and his mirror reflections spring to life far more than any ever did in Duck Soup. The opening sequence where Dumont visits Groucho's fly-by-night detective agency (where Harpo is the given the Quasi-Zeppoesque role as Groucho's Assistant) is wonderful.  But the lengthy Groucho musical number (three DVD chapters!) is pretty much a straight one. There's no tattooed lady, African explorer, or pre-war hysteria to be found. The juvenile's musical number, The Tenement Symphony, is nowhere as mercifully brief as When My Dreams Come True is in the Cocoanuts. Harpo and Chico even participate in it.  Worst of all, however, are the moments where the brothers are made into just any old comedy team, pushing wrong buttons to create chaos, riding on roller skates and unicycles to escape the villain, and serving up a wienie with some Puccini (Or is it Rossini? My mind has blocked it out like a car accident).  You don't gotta sing while you sell. Please don't.  It's sad that the Marx's valedictory with MGM had to be this generic bore. Through no fault of their own, they became personae non grata at the studio and seemed to be given a script pulled at random from a file drawer.  So, if you're a Red Skelton fan, and can ignore the fact you're watching Groucho, Harpo and Chico, by all means, watch The Big Store. If you're a Marx Brothers worshipper (they don't merely have fans), please show their memories respect and keep the DVD on the side that has Go West."
2,"It's nice to see an indie film use an actual orchestra and choir rather than capitulate to the compromised sounds produced by computers and synthesizers. The film's score is not only brilliant in its composition, but equally impressive in its execution. From the opening credits to the chilling end of this film, the music proves to set an appropriate and fitting backdrop from scene to scene. Cristo, the composer, delivers us a score that juxtaposes beautiful sweeping lyrical melodies and hauntingly disturbing music. The inter-play between beauty and beast in the score reflects well both the killer's internal struggle between the forces of good and evil as well as the struggle that ensues between the disturbed killer and her innocent college-aged victims. The choir, magnificently harmonized and blended, is reminiscent of the 'Omen' in its 'hair-raising effectiveness,' but nevertheless maintains its own uniqueness in composition. The composer could be compared to venerable John Williams or perhaps a modern day Tchaikovsky for his orchestration. I don't know if the movie has been released yet, but I would highly recommend finding a release of the score on CD. I believe this film comes to us from Boston. If anyone has more information about the filmmakers, I would appreciate hearing back from you."
2,"My theory: The producers of this film first made the movie ""Gor"". It only took them four days. Then someone noticed that they still had three days left on their equipment rentals, so they decided to film a second movie. Someone put together a script while on a potty break. They used the same sets, the same props, and much the same cast. The end result was ""Outlaw of Gor"".  Jack Palance must have been hard-up for money to do this. It ranks up there with the biggest wastes of talent in movie history, right next to Max von Sydow in ""Strange Brew"" and Sir Lawrence Olivier in ""Clash of the Titans""."
2,"My one liner says that this is an inspiring movie. Unfortunately, some of the other reviewers feel pretty uninspired by it. I guess their ""a priori"" hatred for the protagonist and his religion are the predicate for these feelings. This film is based on true events. It is not "" Mormon propaganda"" as suggested by many. The missionary happens to be a Mormon but the story would be as moving despite the denomination. It is the story of a young man on a religious mission to the Tongan people. His companion is a native and his mission is characterized by a love for this people, not condescension to them. How anyone could watch this film and come away with bad feelings is beyond me. The whole point of the film is about loving our fellow man and giving them due consideration. The protagonist has his detractors in the film also that he eventually wins over with his sincerity and goodness. If some one does not like this film--fine--but to use these pages as a canvas for painting one's hatred demonstrates the need for films of this kind. There is a lot of hatred and bigotry in the world that needs to be done away with. This film demonstrates one example of how understanding and respect develops between people. I'm sorry members of the ""new inquisition"" missed this point. I give it an 8 out of 10."
0,"This has to be, by far, the absolute worst movie I have seen in the last 20 years. When I saw that Michael Madsen was in it I figured it couldn't be too bad a movie since he has been in some pretty decent films, and he was a pretty fair actor. WRONG! No one should waste their time on this film. I fast forwarded through 80 percent of it and I don't feel that I missed a thing."
1,"This is a comedy based on national stereotypes, no doubt. If you leave away pretending you know or you care what Communism was about and how real Russians or Brits are, if you accept and are not hurt by the conventions, you can have fun with this film. Nicole Kidman is at her best, sexy, moving and funny. Ben Chaplin succeeds to avoid being completely out-shadowed by Nicole, and the rest of the cast does good work as well. The final is moving, and logical - movie logics, of course. Worth watching, if you accept the rules of the game."
0,"Christ, oh Christ... One watches stunned, incredulous, and possibly deranged, as this tawdry exercise in mirthless smut unfolds with all the wit and dexterity of a palsied Galapagos tortoise. Can such things be? Does this movie actually exist, or was I the unwitting guinea pig of some shadowy international drugs company, sipping my coffee unaware that it had been spiked with a dangerous hallucinogen? I've seen a lot of films, and a lot of bad films, but nothing prepared me for this; by the end of it I was a gibbering, snivelling wreck, tearing at the carpet with my teeth like a dog, clawing at the walls, howling till my lungs were sore. I pleaded desperately, frenziedly for mercy (to whom this appeal was made, I don't know), and longed with burning desire for the soothing balm of Ozu Yasujiro. Sweet Weeping Jesus, the memories... sometimes they come back to me. When I'm at my most vulnerable, when I'm least able to handle them. I shudder, I break down in tears, I bite my fingernails till my hands are slathered with blood, but I can't quite banish the awful flashbacks from my mind. I'm haunted. I'm damaged. I'm a shell of a man.  The other user comments here suggest that I am not alone in having undergone this terrifying experience, which can only mean one of two things: a) the film does, in fact, exist, or b) I am but one victim among legions of an international conspiracy of truly sinister proportions. What is quite mind-boggling is that some people seem to have enjoyed their ordeal, or at least have not been left traumatised by it. Perhaps they're part of the operation. God damn them, the maniacs! God damn them all to Hell!!!!!!"
0,"What a HUGE pile of dung. Shot-on-video (REALLY crappy camcorder, NOT digital) pile of garbage. It is without a doubt, the stupidest thing ever made. The fact that this crap was actually released is completely asanine. Everyone who sees it will become stupider for having watched it. Seriously. I felt like it killed several brain cells after I watched this garbage. The positive reviews of this a$$crap were obviously made by the ""filmmaker"" (and I use the term VERY loosely) himself and/or his family and friends because no normal person with the intelligence of a squirrel would honestly like this waste of life. Trust me, stay the hell away from this video. You'll thank me for it. Avoid it like herpes."
2,"Oh dear. They tried, but I'm afraid that a 28 minute pilot in Britain DOES NOT GO INTO 22 minutes. Well it would if you didn't have an extra character, more plot and changing lines like ""My library books are overdue"" to some rubbish about Baseball cards. Too rushed, too short - the only redeeming features being Jane Leeves and of course the always excellent Llewelyn."
2,"The last couple of sneak previews brought films full of violence and so I was hoping for a change as I didn't want to leave the cinema in the middle of a film again. Although this film is very positive, I sometimes wished back to something more exciting. It seems to be a common misconception to believe that a life full of tragedy automatically turns into a good story. This film is the perfect proof for it. It swings back and forth between tragedy and bliss but there's no suspense. Even the tragedy is predictable and unavoidable. The conclusions that are drawn from all this are commonplace. Of course, from a personal, private perspective it's different but from the point of view of a film there's nothing in it. This makes me wonder why people seem to think that all this is more interesting if it happens in an exotic place. I guess many, many people have gone through all this and worse and no one seems to think it worthwhile telling a story about them. There's one good thing to be said about this film, however. It goes against the grain of modern film producing. It's quiet and the acting is toned down."
2,"Barry Pepper and Thomas Jane portray two legendary baseball heroes like they grew up watching them play and play. The supporting cast adds to this film as Jennifer Crystal Foley (Pat Maris), Chris Bauer (Bob Cerv), Anthony Michael Hall (Whitey Ford), and Bruce McGill (Ralph Houk) brilliantly display the up and down emotions of dealing with two players thrust into the limelight of trying to break one of baseball's all time records. Billy Crystal does a masterful job directing this cast to recreate childhood memories of HIS hero (Mantle) and the battle he faces from Maris and his own demons."
2,"If there is one thing in this world of media that infuriates me, it is an iconic company's attempts to do something incredibly stupid. For one example are Disney's attempts to abandon hand drawn animation, and shove CGI animated movies in the Disney canon and consider them ""Full Length Animated Features"". What's worse is it starts with one cataclysmic abomination entitled Chicken Little. As we know about the original Aesop fable, this movie contraries from it and contains an abusive amount of clichés, pop culture references, movie references, and so much more clustered together. I can't stop thinking that this is the textbook definition of ""worst movie ever"". Compared to other poor movies out there, such as Batman & Robin, Battlefield Earth, or North, they are Gods.  We're first jumped into a chaotic scene, that BEGS me to laugh with an Indiana Jones joke and a chain of baby rabbits, when Chicken rings a bell in an Oakland town to warn everyone that the sky is falling in such a panic, later revealed that an acorn fell on him. Yeah, that's our hero, ladies and gentlemen; someone who chaotically grabs people's attention just for the most far fetched warning. A year passes by, and he's the village idiot, and a movie of him is in production. Gee who would think that? He's teased in school for his idiocy and is friends with the most horribly named characters with the worst traits in the world. Abby, also named Ugly Duckling who gives advice to Chicken and establishes nothing except for a weak love antique. Fish out of the Water, a fish with a water helmet on his head, who only performs pop culture references. And Runt of the Litter, who's an obnoxious ugly fat big that flaps its arms around so much, and doesn't do a single thing useful in the movie. My question is, what the hell names are these?? Fish out of the Water? Runt of the Litter?? Who comes up with these names? Were these writers even trying? And if anything, you could remove all these characters, and nothing in the story would alter!   The entire first half is a rapid fire of high school clichés and a montage to a baseball game for Chicken's reputation to regain. You know, something you'd see on a TV sitcom. This is all utterly pointless because in the second half, the alien plot is in and Chicken loses his reputation again. At this point, why did I have to watch the first half of clichés and sport montages when he becomes the village idiot again? So aliens, reminiscent of War of the Worlds, invade as chaos is aroused again. Citizens are getting vaporized by Martian beams. You know. For kids! There's jettisoned little three eyed orange alien has to be returned to stop this whole mess. He gets returned, but the martians are actually friendly space neighbors. OK, at this point, why did they attack the city in the first place if they're generous? So now that Chicken's reputation is back the second time, his movie is changed to a Sci-fi Trek flick. What did we learn from all this? Practically nothing!   The story is messy, and absolutely frustrating to understand. What was the movie telling me, or at least trying? The tag line implies ""The sky is Falling"". So was it supposed to be about aliens? If so, why was everything else there? Why a baseball game? Was it telling me not to jump to conclusions, or actually listen to someone say something far fetched, despite of no evidence revealed until later in the film? If you asked me, nothing happened! The movie was telling me nothing!   While most Disney films contained amazing scores, this musical soundtrack features nothing but decade old songs from groups like Spice Girls. Something in which would amplify the anonymous pop cultural references in the movie. The animation is mediocre, and the character designs are terrible. For the most part, it looks like stop motion, and Foxy Loxy looks like a squirrel. The biggest shame is that some big stars like Zack Braff, Patrick Stewart and Don Knotts have taken roles in this film, and is directed by Mark Dindal, who's known for Cats Don't Dance, and the Emperor's New Groove. Both of which are fantastic films. Some people used these stars as a defense to the film, but really, it doesn't matter who the creators are. What matters is if the movies's good or not. You'll might as well state that Howard the Duck, produced by George Lucas, was great. That would sound ridiculous.  Chicken Little is unbelievably retarded. The story talks about nothing with no sense of originality, the characters are annoying and useless, the animation is poor, and it brings a weak soundtrack. I can't say anything good about this hunk of garbage. Chicken Little is a disgrace to the Disney Canon, and a definition of a CGI used wrongly as well as it's an example of modern cinema crap fest. The biggest blame goes to Disney CEO, Michael Eisner, for assuming that 2D animation is dead. Good for him, maybe he should have thought twice about that before firing the Disney animators in the process, considering there are hand drawn Disney sequels, and Studio Ghibli films they distribute.  Chicken Little is an inexcusable, unoriginal, effortless abomination, and it's completely unforgivable. One of, actually THE worst movie I have ever seen in my life."
2,"The Informers really is an unusual kind of terrible, but there is actually a very real possibility that it is a misunderstood work of unparalleled directorial ingenuity. The off-kilter overdubbing, the soft focus camera-work, the trite youth-gone-wild bullsh*t dialogue, the nihilistic soft-core group sex - its all exactly like a DTV Zalman King production, and nothing quite sums up the rank, dilapidated sleaziness of the early 1980s than a DTV Zalman King. If Gregor Jordan's career ends up warranting serious critical reappraisals in the future, then this is going to be the gleaming, once-misinterpreted jewel in some chancer's festival retrospective.  But from here, its just appalling. The good actors involved are coasting (Billy Bob Thornton in particular looks as if he's performing from the vantage point of a prozac coma) and the bad actors are left to use their questionable skills to turn every other scene into full-tilt soap opera. The screenplay (co-authored, surprisingly, by Brett Easton Ellis himself) is completely unaware of itself, and so tiresomely arch and condescending that it feels, again, like a product of the 1980's rather than some kind of commentary of it.  Reeling off a plot synopsis would be beyond pointless, as it consists of little more than a series of unconnected, uninteresting things happening to some deeply unlikeable people. Everyone appears to be operating under the assumption that this is a satire, but the funniest thing about it is the sheer inappropriateness of the supposedly suckerpunch coda. No prizes.  American Psycho aside, if you want a to see Ellis' rather one-note universe rendered shrewdly on screen, you should really check out Roger Avary's severely underrated Rules Of Attraction."
2,"Thank you Bruce for allowing God such unhindered access to your life during the filming of this. I don't think you will ever fully know the impact for The Kingdom that your willingness to be used by Him has had on this generation. It is an amazing piece of work. The joy that is evident in your smile told me more about Jesus Christ than anything else I have ever read or seen. Thank you for being the first Jesus to smile, to laugh and to weep with such abandon. Everybody needs to see this! Even if you are not a Christian this movie is the best adaption of the gospel according to Matthew that has ever been made. What is so brilliant is that there has been no interference from any scriptwriter. It was taken straight from the Bible - word for word and that's what counts!"
2,"I bought this movie. I had never seen it, but I figured since it had the ""Return of the King"" name it would be decent. I was horribly mistaken. I have tried to watch this movie about 3 times. Every single time I have fallen asleep only to be woken up by terrible music. IF you must see this film, rent it. Do not buy it. Save yourself from the torment of actually owning this movie.  Why is it so bad?  1) Terrible music sung by a guy with a terrible voice.  2) Really doesn't follow what happened in the book (I know that sometimes movies cant follow a book exactly, but this movie doesn't even attempt to do so). 3) The music was terrible. 4) Very bad animation. Speed Racer has better animation.  5) Bad music. 6) Did I mention the horrendous dialogue? Sam has around 15 minutes straight of dialogue that makes almost no sense. 7) I really hope I mentioned the horrific music.  Those are only 7 of the many reasons I have for not liking this movie. It really is not deserving of having any name that deals with any of J.R.R. Tolkiens works. This movie is a scar for anything that deals with Lord of the Rings."
1,"I don't know what movie some of these other people watched, but they must have seen a different ""Joseph Smith: Prophet of the Restoration"" than the one I saw.  I think the movie was both well-done and inspiring. I think it's definitely worth watching. It's apparent from the outset that a lot of care went into the making of this film. The background scenery is beautiful.  I think the film does a good job of portraying Joseph Smith both as a man and as a prophet. Joseph's spiritual experiences are portrayed with taste and reverence.  I would definitely recommend watching this movie."
0,"I will probably always go to see a Woody Alleb movie, as one never knows when he just might make a real return to his past greatness. Just one or two great moments or lines could make it worthwhile. sadly however this film just does'nt make it on any score. Saying thar actually makes me sad and even a little guilty. I'm sure my reaction is much like a lot of other fans of Woody, but what can one say? It's probably time for him to concentrate on his Clarinett, which in my opinion, he is rather quite good. Saying all of this, I'll still probably go to any new film Woody may come out with in the future. There's always hope and I'll continue to love and respect The WOODY!!"
2,"The future, we are told, are what we make of it. Philip K. Dick did not want to take that chance, so he wrote many many many short stories about the future of man and where we, as a society, were headed. Blade Runner, Total Recall, Paycheck, Screamers, and Minority Report are all short stories written by Dick about the future that have been turned into a movie, and most have a less than enthusiastic view of where we are headed. In Minority Report, we see the effects of predicting the future to the point of crimes are prevented by arresting murderers before they kill. If that does not appear logical, there is a quick little scene early in the movie that addresses those concerns, and on the surface makes sense. Tom Cruise plays the Washington, DC pre-crime chief, John Anderton, who runs the investigators who rely on 3 scientifically engineered beings who can see murders before they happen. The system, of course, raises civil liberty issues, but seems to work perfectly, that is until Anderton is fingered for a murder. The rest of the movie, Anderton tries to not only prove that he is innocent, but also that he was set up, possibly by an oily Department of Justice figure who is investigating Precrime before it goes national after an election, played by Colin Farrell. Directed by Steven Spielberg, Minority Report plays as both a ""Whodunnit?"" and a futuristic exercise of science fiction. Much time was spent on designing the Washington, DC of the 2050s, including cars that run on magnets, virtual reality stations, and much more throughout the film. The most interesting design is of the ""sick sticks"" used by cops to bring down criminals. The blueish tint given to the film also gives us a cold feeling, a future that is not as loving or as hospitable as the time we live in, another trait of a Dick story. A wonderful movie the works for both the crime buff and the science fiction fan."
0,"A sentimental school drama set in Denmark, 1969, ""We Shall Overcome"" offers a pathetic Danish take on US culture. Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke), a flower-power obsessed, naive 13-year-old, exits with half his ear hanging off from brutal master Lindum-Svendsen's (Bent Mejding) office. Lindum-Svendsen, a school director, portrayed as a fascistoid tyrant, has the local community in control. Lindum-Svendsen's gone too far this time, and with his father, recovering from a mental breakdown (sure, there wasn't enough drama already..), and overly stereotyped hippie music teacher Mr Svale ('Hi, call me Freddie'), Frits stands up for justice.  Tell you what. It's so unconvincing, over-(method-)acted, and so full of misery, that as a 'family' picture this grotesque -filled with cliché's- excuse for a movie fails miserably to convince non-Scandinavian audiences. Sorry, kind danish readers, to crash like this into your sentimental journeys.. But it's definitely NOT a tale about a 'boy becoming a man by fighting the system'. The boy never becomes a man, but rather remains a naive, big eyed cry-face. If you call a church of small minded small town folk, led by a dictator like cartoonish character ""the system"", I'm sorry if I'm missing something.  If you're into family pictures, go see Happy Feet instead.."
2,"I had my qualms about seeing this, but finally took it out. The acting and direction are super. The story surprised me, and I really felt for these characters. Forest Whitaker is another one of our great underrated actors. I give this a 10, and I rarely do that with films I review."
2,"I saw this alleged film when someone on a forum linked to it as ""something creepy that will give you nightmares."" I knew nothing about it, and when I saw it, my thoughts were: ""That's not too bad for amateur internet stuff."" Ya know, you see so much random stuff on the internet, I just figure a couple of guys thought:  ""Wouldn't it be bitchin' if we took Alien Autopsy, combined it with The Blair Witch Project, and set it to your cat chasing a laser pointer across your old Casio keyboard?""  ""Dude, that's so awesome! You ever try tequila in a bong?""  Then I come here and find out this is some kind of professional production by a legit industry professional, and hear words like ""genius"" being tossed around.  Oh my.  ""Rubber Johnny"" has maybe 15 or 30 seconds of (marketing hype word warning) ""creepy"" imagery in it, repeated AD-FREAKIN'-NAUSEUM over a five minute or whatever running time. Those 30 seconds of ""disturbing"" ""creepiness"" are examples of two forms of lazy film-making: 1. Our unease at seeing a deformed person, in this case one that's naked, in a wheelchair, apparently in distress; and 2. Heavily filtered, unfocused, shaky camera work and motion blur combined with abrupt editing and the use of noise-bursts to shock you -- a gimmicky cliché more often associated with ""reality"" shows on the Sci-Fi Network than with, say, something anyone would actually want to watch.  Hitchcock used the shock-audio/abrupt-editing technique to great effect in the shower scene in ""Psycho"", but he was pioneering it, and that scene lasted only seconds. Just think how much impact ""Psycho"" would have had with 30 or 40 shower scenes! It positively makes your skin crawl, doesn't it?  Even taken as a music video, it's not anywhere near as (yawn) ""creepy"", imaginative, memorable or compelling as old Tool videos. And the music is forgotten as soon as the thing mercifully ends.  If you want disturbing imagery and general weirdness, watch David Lynch's ""Eraserhead"". While it's not the masterpiece some claim, the sophistication and maturity of that nearly 30 year old movie are light-years ahead of this forgettable bit of internet debris.  My final verdict: It's not too bad for random, amateur internet stuff -- but not nearly as good as Retarded Animal Babies."
0,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits   In this debut effort for Nick Park's beloved man and dog, they are forced to fly to the moon when good old Wallace runs out of cheese.  As well as being the shortest feature at just 22 minutes, this W/G adventure is also the earliest and it kinda shows. The plasticine animation is a little creaky and funny here, sort of reminiscent of the Mork animation about the little man in the box.  Admirable though the craftsmanship behind it is, I've never actually been hugely into Wallace & Gromit (maybe a bit too clean and traditional for someone of my generation.) The only one I've really enjoyed is The Wrong Trousers (and that was more from when I was younger and less aware of, shall we say, the seedier pleasures of life.) I was driven to actively seek out this early effort due to the resurgence in popularity as a result of the hugely successful recent film adaptation.  As technically impressive as the first two (all things considered!) this one lacks the emotional angle it's successors were to possess. That being said, it's fairly good fun as a first try and certainly set the standard for greater things to come. Two stars, but a good two stars. **"
2,"When I first read the story, I thought it would be fun to see an ordinary thief change into a legendary general! But what I have seen is more than just a comedy! It is truly an epic on small scale! And a comment on the political situation of North and South Korea! The excellent combination of humor,drama,a little bit of science fiction and a lot of action makes this a movie not to miss! The cast is great and the story is wonderful! It never get's boring! Before you know it the movie is over! The beautiful cinematography and some nice cgi effects make the viewing experience even more intense and pleasurable! I know that some viewers will be put off by the time travel aspect in the story! It is only used as a tool! The focus is on the characters and their actions! The spectacular finale is truly a heroic bloodshed! I enjoyed ""Heaven's Soldiers"" immensely and I think that it certainly deserves a higher rating than it got! Trust me this is an amazing movie!"
0,"The first ten minutes of this movie about making an international movie in Belgium, are fine: you see real chaos on the set, a producer on the edge of a nervous breakdown, the cool has been-director (Mickey Rourke), the bad tempered star, etc. You have seen everything before, but it's well done. BUT THEN! The rest of the time the film just repeats itself: the same ten minutes over and over again. No climax, no dramatic development, no good acting, not even bad acting, it just goes on and on and on. Mickey Rourke has two good minutes when his character talks about his f**ked up career in a scene where reality and fiction meet. Altogether, that makes 12 good minutes.  "
0,"First, let me state that I am a big fan of Ashley Judd; that's why I was curious to check out this, her debut role. No argument that her talent is apparent and her performance excellent. I guess I can also see how the professional critics liked the aesthetic content of the story. However, I like to think that movies are meant to entertain us and that is where this movie fails.  By the halfway point, I found myself thinking, ""How much longer do we have to watch a bored shop girl, idly standing around a deserted souvenir shop, rearranging the merchandise?"" It seemed to go on forever!  Then, I thought, maybe this is one of those movies where the director tries to lull the audience into a relaxed state before hitting them with some dynamic event. No such luck. The movie continues it's bland, boring, uneventful story all the way to the end.  I'm not saying this because I'm an action-junkie. I like all kinds of movies, especially romantic-comedies. But I expect to be entertained.  Add the fact that the cinematography and sound quality are comparable to your neighbor's bad home movies. Depressing!  I just don't get how anyone could like this movie. Zero-entertainment value. The longest 114 minutes of my life.  "
2,"I was kinda looking forward to seeing how they ended the Candyman trilogy and the story actually looked entertaining. I remember when I was younger getting a peek at the movie on HBO, but I think I remember falling asleep, so it was at least something I could put to rest of what the rest of the movie was about. Candyman 3: Day of the Dead turned out to be an ordinary sequel with nothing to remember and it wasn't up to par with the original Candyman.  Caroline, the great great grand daughter of Candyman, is still haunted by the dreams of what her family and Candyman had to go through. No one believes her of course that he is still real, Candyman is back though and he is murdering her friends one by one while she gets the blame. She tries to uncover the legend and figure out what he wants from her, but she might end up loosing the only true friend of her's.  This film was sadly typical and even for a horror movie it was plain pathetic, I do like a little cheesiness every once in a while, but for a great story like Candyman, this was really sad. Well, I can see why they didn't make a fourth installment to the Candyman series, big surprise there. Well, at least I'm done... or am I? *Insert cynical laughter here*   2/10"

1,"This has to be the funniest stand up comedy I have ever seen. Eddie Izzard is a genius, he picks in Brits, Americans and everyone in between. His style is completely natural and completely hilarious. I doubt that anyone could sit through this and not laugh their a** off. Watch, enjoy, it's funny."
1,"When Philo Vance (Edmund Lowe) is standing precariously on the edge of a balcony high above the city, apparently hypnotized and just about to step to his death,it immediately reminded me of a nearly identical scene in another film made nine years later, ""The Woman in Green"" in which Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone)is similarly about to hurl himself into space while being hypnotized.   Happily, both Philo Vance and Sherlock Holmes survive these attempts at murder by unscrupulous criminals. Exciting cinematic suspense in both these scenes. When will they learn you can't cloud the minds of great fictional detectives ?"
2,"In my opinion the Dutch movie scene has been enormously enriched by Moonlight. Even without many words, director Paula van der Oest puts together a clear, interesting and compelling story. The acting of especially the very young Laurien van den Broeck was fantastic. Feelings and emotions come across the screen very convincingly.  But the editing, cinematography and art direction in this film really put it next to its American huge-budget brothers. In contrary to most previous Dutch productions, these aspects are incredibly professional, even comparable to i.e. 'The Sixth Sense' as to creating tension and atmosphere, and to 'Requiem for a Dream' as to editing.  I've seen the movie in Nijmegen, as part of a weekend-long review of the Dutch Movie Festival, and had the chance to attend a 'talkshow' with director Paula van der Oest as one of the guests. A great experience.  Foreign readers, please don't let yourself be scared off by the Dutch crew: not a Dutch word is spoken during the movie, set in Luxembourg. Main language is English. Dutch readers: absolutely go see this movie! It will show you the enormous progress of our very own filming scene."
2,"I don't think I've ever used the phrase, ""a movie everyone can enjoy"" to describe a movie, but I'll do it here. OK, done. I'll give props where it's due, for a PG movie for kids, this was surprisingly engaging, non-cliché, and very, very well written.  There aren't a lot of fantasy movies I like, and that has to do with the way they're presented to you. They present the world to you in an already existing state, bombarding you with everything without gradually introducing you to its various elements. They present these life or death scenarios without truly exploring why we're supposed to care about the world's inhabitants in the first place. I like this movie because we're learning about the world at the same rate as the four kids here (assuming you haven't read the books, which I haven't). In fact, it was the great acting done by the kids that kept me interested enough in the ""pre-fantasy"" portions of the movie before we finally entered the fantastical realm, after which I cared enough about the characters to be invested in their ultimate outcomes.  **The character Lucy single-handedly kept me interested with her GREAT acting in the beginning where she was prominently featured. She was better than a good 70-83% of grown actresses that I've seen, and probably 98% of child actresses not named Dakota Fanning and a select other few. I loved her response when asked by the faun about the human beings' hand-shaking ritual. ""Yeah, I don't know, why DO we do that??""  **I loved the interaction between the kids. I loved the tension there. In most PG movies the good guys are usually black and white, you don't have ugly things like traitors, jealousy, and greed.  **A mark of a well-written movie is how many times you DON'T have to say to a character on screen, ""why are you doing that?"" or ""why AREN'T you doing this?"" Prime example, in the beginning after Lucy returned from Narnia as she re-entered the wardrobe, the character specifically knew that she had been gone for apparently hours, so as she re-enters, the first thing she does is to shout out to everyone who inevitably will be worried about her, that she's OK. After they question her, she then realistically asks, ""wait, what? You mean to tell me that after our hide and seek game, from your perspective I must've disappeared for hours, and you didn't wonder where I was???"" That's perfect. That's exactly how a real person would behave, and the actress pulled off the well-written lines just as perfectly, as she questioned her siblings with a confused look. I'm pointing this out because I can specifically think of other movies with analogous situations where the lines the character would've said would've been ALL wrong, and the intonation with which the actor delivers the line would've been so unrealistically understated.  I only have a couple complaints:  **When the lion is lying dead on the concrete slab, and Lucy and Susan go up to him, I don't understand why Lucy was so easily talked out of using the injury healing potion she was given by...Santa Claus earlier. She first begins to use it, but then is told by Susan that it's too late, implying that since he's already dead, the potion would do no good since it's meant to heal injuries only. But how did she know the exact boundaries or properties of this magic elixir? It's MAGIC. How do you know that it won't revive him? No one specifically ever defined its limitations. Besides, what's the worst that could happen? Just pour the liquid on his wound, worst-case scenario is you get red dye on his fur (I didn't know until later you're supposed to consume the potion, not apply it directly to the wound).  **I didn't like the sword fighting scene between Peter and the witch. It just looked weak, like they were struggling to swing the sword(s). Peter, I can understand, since he's a kid, but the witch should have been a lot smoother using the dual swords.  **This one is minor, but, the grown versions of the kids at the end just looked very goofy.  Those are hardly plot holes or badly written scenes however. If my only major gripe about a 2 hour+ movie is the non-use of a Phoenix Down on a fallen Red XIII, then it's a pretty good movie. Sure the overall arc of the story may have been predictable, but there were still plenty of dramatic moments along the way and you enjoyed the ride. The plot didn't feel contrived, it was believable for what it was, and the characters are extremely likable, to the point where I was hoping that even the CGI animals don't get hurt or killed. This movie has a lot heart and certain charm to it that leaves you happy for seeing it.  ***Random personal trivia: I finally saw this three years after the movie had come out, but it wasn't random. I've always had it in the back of my head that I would eventually get around to seeing this, and it was all because of an enduring three second image in my head that I remembered when they advertised this movie on TV. It was the scene at the end showing a front view of the lion and the four kids as they walk towards the camera, towards the coronation area. As corny as it sounds, there was just something noble and inspirational about that scene."
2,"I enjoyed the movie very much. I thought Lee Majors captured the essence of Will Kane better than Gary Cooper. David Carradine was great as a likable, not so bad, not so good, down on his luck guy, who wasn't real particular about the letter of the law. Bonanza's ""Adam"" was a particularly unlikable bad guy as the law officer who conducted himself and the duties of his office to satisfy his own personal greed and needs. The theme of a wrong, for which the good guy seeks recompense, was good and evident throughout the movie, as it evolved into a theme of ""standing up to evil."" Lee Majors was great as Will Kane, just trying to do right and finally not being able to walk away from evil, knowing he had what it takes to fight it."
0,"I generally LIKE watching Burt Lancaster's films--especially when he is needed to go nuts with his imposing screen presence like in Elmer Gantry. However, his greatest strength, his magnetism, was occasionally also his greatest weakness as he rarely, if ever, underplayed ANYTHING. And it is this lack of subtlety that really hinders The Rainmaker. Now I understand that his character was meant to be a sort of showman but how Katherine Hepburn could fall under his spell is completely inexplicable. She is supposed to be smart but doesn't seem so when Lancaster's blarney is being thrown about the screen! In addition to this, the story is perhaps one of the most stagy looking films I have ever seen and it is way too obvious that this is a movie based on a play. It just looks like it was mostly filmed in a sound stage instead of in the great wide open West like it was supposed to be.  Overall, a very overrated film."
2,"In the era when Shahrukh khan's over-acting is considered 'thrilling' and rated as top-notch by the Karan Johar circus... this movie proves that this new actor has the acting skill and confidence to make these over-hyped Khans run for their money.  This movie respects audience's intelligence and does not pursue the lowest common denominator by adding stupidly choreographed 'balle balle' songs.  This movie is about reality, it is about death and it is about the brutal war for survival. It is imaginative enough that doesn't bore the audience with obvious and unnecessary dialogue and director's clever use of music focuses on character's emotions and the underlying fear that governs everyone's behavior.  See this movie and compare it with the more 'mainstream' family oriented movies and you will see why RGV is one of the best director in the industry. Here the hero does-not cry, he is sober and mature enough to think and act. This the Khans will never be able to do.  10/10"
2,"I was lucky enough to catch a free preview screening of this masterpiece of slap stick kung fu genius, and i feel that i should now pay the theater anyways. Let me explain:  Suppose God had a bad day and decided to cheer himself up by creating a new man. This man was one part Charlie Chaplin, one part Bruce Lee, a half a teaspoon Jackie Chan, and an injection of every Looney Toon ever created.  This is quite likely how Stephen Chow came into existence.  Now imagine that after creating this man, God bestow on him an army of stunt-men, a type writer, a movie camera, a hefty special effects budget, and a eighty wardrobes worth of axes, black suits and top hats.  This is quite likely how Kung Fu Hustle came into existence.  Ebert has already said that this a movie where Jackie Chan and Buster Keaton meet Bugs Bunny and Quentin Tarantino, but i think that needs to be amended : Imagine a movie where Jackie Chan and Buster Keaton meet Bugs Bunny and Quentin Tarantino, and then the whole crew go to a opium bar for 36 hours. This movie was great, at least as good if not a little better than Shaolin Soccer, the smash hit Chow made back into two thousand. You never doubt the abilities of any random person to be a master of kungfu or, completely not a master of kung fu.  Also, the cartoonish beating and contortions that every character seem to be able to endure are so brilliantly installed in the film that despite their utter impossibility, no one ever questions their validity. Characters and fly through the atmosphere, surrounded in an aura of flame and not even have a scratch when they reach the ground.  Where Sin City was a living comic book Kung Fu Huslte a living cartoon, and no one stops laughing for the entire time."
2,"""Smiling Fish and Goat on Fire"" is, in several ways, an Italians-in-L.A. version of ""The Brothers McMullen.""  It's evidently done by NYU students, with the print blown-up from 16 mm, grainy shadows and all, and filmed primarily in the house of the brothers who co-star in and co-wrote the screenplay.  The problems with the Opposite Sex are pretty much the same too, with one being a happy-go-lucky philanderer (that's ""Smiling Fish"") and the other a straight-arrow accountant being shredded by his long-time girlfriend (that's ""Goat on Fire"").   The new, magic realism element is an elderly black sage from the early days of race movies who provides oddball advice on love and the magic of the movies.   As twenty-somethings-in-and-out-of-love movies go, this is cute and likable.  (originally written 9/16/2000)"

2,"An idealistic doctor, Paul Henreid, is a counselor or something at a new prison for naughty young girls. No walls, but humane treatment -- that sort of thing. The fly in the ointment is the headmistress or foreman or whatever she is, the top sergeant, who runs the place on a day-to-day basis. And what an old-fashioned meanie she is, groomed like Mrs. Danvers or maybe the wife in ""American Gothic"".  This movie was one of a spate that came out in the post-war years dealing with one or another social problem, often, as here, penology. Among the others were ""The Snake Pit,"" ""Sniper,"" ""Gentleman's Agreement,"" ""Crossfire,"" others whose titles don't come to mind at the moment. This is a lesser example of the genre, but not entirely without interest.  What makes it interesting is that, though Paul Henreid, Ingrid Bergman's husband in ""Casablanca"" seven years earlier, was by now over the hill and reduced to B pictures, the movie is full of those naughty young girls, including the 18-year-old Rita Moreno and the 19-year-old Ann Francis. They run around in their skivvies, get into fights, talk nasty, are cynical about everything, trying to run away -- in other words, these luscious young beauties are just begging to be spanked. That's all they really need. They don't need an understanding headmaster, just a couple of whacks. Oh, not savage whacks. Not at all. Rather, deeply caring whacks, whacks of love, so to speak, not enough to hurt but just enough to warm. Why didn't Paul Henreid try that instead of this antiquated humanism? Huh? I'll bet he WANTED to turn Ann Francis over his knee, that lanky and insinuating blond vixen, and teach her a lesson. You can see it in his face. The gentle smile can't mask the lascivious grin of the maniac underneath. Come to think of it, if that didn't work, why he could just have THEM spank HIM. They'd be learning a trade too -- professional dominatrix.   Anyway, if he didn't, he must be as crazy as the rest of this unimaginative movie. Some of the shots are striking; in others the lighting alone could have been handled by an alert ten-year-old kid. But why go on?  This movie is ""reformist"" in the same way that Cecil B. DeMille's early movies showed a lot of nudity, just to make sure we knew how sinful nudity was; or in the same way as one of those anti-war pictures that show us the brutality of combat before we inevitably win the battle. What hypocrisy."
2,"includes SPOILERS  Well we finally we get to learn who Sadako really is. I felt sorry for Sadako after watching this film, it was really amazing to find out what really happened to her and what led her to become what she became. This is definitely the best film in the series.   You couldn't help but sympathize for Sadako after seeing how much hatred she had recieved for being different. Her tragic and horrible death at the theatre and her second death when her father throws her in the well made Ringu 0: Baadusei an incredible sad story. To only think that that young and beautiful girl was inside the well for 30 years and couldn't get out (almost) justifies everything she did afterwards.  Sadako just wanted her story to be told. A must for all the Ringu fanatics."
1,"This 2004 Oscar nominee is a very short b/w film in Spanish. A young woman goes into a café, gets a coffee, and notices a couple of musicians standing silently with their instruments. All the patrons are motionless, like mannequins. One guy, however, is quite jolly and breaks into a song about what goes on at 7:35 in the morning. There is one surprising moment after another until the end which is quite, well, surprising. The people, the place, everything looks quite ordinary. And like the musical piece ""Bolero"", the thing keeps building until the climax. With its structure, theme,movement and wit,it is an 8 minute masterpiece."
0,"This series has its ups and occasional downs, and the latter is the case, here. There's an agreeable amount of spatter, with an inventive implementation of the Baby Cart's weapons, but the editing film is a seriously disjointed, the film-making itself rougher than usual. At times, the action slows to a crawl as the camera follows the wordless wanderings of the ""cub,"" who nearly gets lost early on. All in all, disappointment.  That said, there's a spaghetti eastern quality to the music and action that may win the approval of dedicated viewers. This installment spends much of its time following the minor misadventures of the little boy, who begins to stare into the abyss of death his father opened for him."
2,"This movie is actually a very high quality soap opera. The story is better, as is the acting and direction, but still down deep this is a soap. Now this isn't meant as a criticism, but this is more a description of all the plot twists and betrayals--sort of like a season of a typical soap squeezed into one movie.  Kirk Douglas does a really good job of portraying a sociopathic user--a Hollywood big-shot who stomps on all his friends and enemies alike in order to get ahead. He is the major star and focus of the film, despite it having a very strong supporting cast.  After you see this film, try to find the sequel, TWO WEEKS IN ANOTHER TOWN. While it isn't quite as good, it's still an excellent film and shows what happens to people like Kirk once their star has faded."
2,"This is terrible. Do not watch! This made-for-TV 'extravaganza' is clearly intended to cash in on the success of Raiders of the Lost Ark and the other Indiana Jones films; however it is but a very pale shadow.   The characters are less than two-dimensional. Van Dien's character clearly tries to be Indiana Jones and fails so badly it's not even funny. He even dresses like Indiana Jones. However he has none of the charm and intelligence needed to be a believable character.   I don't expect, or want, fantasy to be realistic; but the characters have to act logically within the fantasy world the writer and director creates. They do not here.  I would rather watch paint dry than this drivel."
2,"This one of the most boring movies i have ever seen!. Nothing happens, until the final 15 to 20 minutes!, it's basically just people wandering around, screaming and arguing, there is hardly any action, just lots of boring dialog, with unlikable characters, and a pretty uninteresting main villain.I got this on a 8 horror movie 2 disc set. I don't really have anything more to say, about this, god awful film. The Direction is terrible!. George Gage, does a terrible job here, with a boring location, terrible camera work and most importantly the pace is extremely boring!. There is a tiny bit of blood, a few bloody gunshot wounds, bloody stabbing, gory bird attack. The Acting is not good at all. Sonny Landham, is bad here, he is uninteresting, and seemed bored, i like the guy, but his performance here was terrible. Steve Kanaly, is okay but nothing great as the main hero,and was the best of the lot. Karen Carlson, is annoying, here, and very unlikable.Same goes Macon McCalman Overall Avoid like the plague! BOMB out of 5"
2,"Going by the previous comment here I thought this movie would be comical exploration into the kung-fu world. What a mistake that was! The only laughs I got were at the expense of the acting and the script (if there even was a script, often it felt as though the entire movie was being ad-libbed by a first-year college movie class). Although there are numerous references to classic kung-fu movies, they don't come across as a tongue-in-cheek homage, but rather a pathetic attempt to legitimise the meaningless content. There are plenty of low brow jokes which only serve reinforce the weak script and poorly written characters, with nothing original or witty as a saving grace. A waste of time & money."
2,"A cute show. Nothing made me roll on the floor, but still cute. Carole Lombard was soooo beautiful. And she was secure enough in it to take a comedic role where she would make faces, and have her hair wet, and other things that many beautiful actresses would not. I recommend."
1,"I enjoyed Still Crazy more than any film I have seen in years. A successful band from the 70's decide to give it another try. They start by playing some gigs in some seedy European venues, with hilarious results. The music is fantastic, the script and acting are terrific. The characters are spot on, especially the lead singer with the high heavy metal voice, makeup and personality problems. The concert at the end was unreal. Go and see it, preferably in a cinema with a good sound system :)"
2,"Because of the warning of gratuitous violence with the provision that ""no one under 17 will be admitted"", I found myself stumbling into this movie on the Classic Television Showbiz site. It concerns a struggling painter (director Abel Ferrara) who lives with two women-one his lover who left her husband and another a druggie who's the other woman's lover and hangs with a punk band that just moved in another apartment room-as he tries to fight his demons by drilling holes into many homeless men that live below. There's some details I've left out but while there's some interesting developments later in the narrative, especially at the end, it's mostly pretty repetitious concerning the killings though there's also a sexy shower scene with the female roommates and some pretty entertaining guitar licks during the punk band scenes as well as one amusing scene at a bus stop with one derelict constantly bothering other patrons. Knowing this director later made the cult movie Ms. 45, which I have yet to watch, I approached this movie with some interest but I'd only recommend The Driller Killer if you're interested in anything Mr. Ferrara made and not if you want to watch a slasher flick (though those drill scenes can be fascinating to watch)."
0,"I'm trying to picture the pitch for Dark Angel. ""I'm thinking Matrix, I'm thinking Bladerunner, I'm thinking that chick that plays Faith in Angel, wearing shiny black leather - or some chick just like her, leave that one with us. Only - get this! - we'll do it without any plot, dialogue, character, decent action or budget, just some loud bangs and a hot chick in shiny black leather straddling a big throbbing bike. Fanboys dig loud bangs and hot chicks in shiny black leather straddling big throbbing bikes, right?""  Flashy, shallow, dreary, formulaic, passionless, tedious, dull, dumb, humourless, desultory, barely competent. Live action anime without any action, or indeed any life. SF just the way Joe Fanboy likes it, in fact. :("
1,"Quite simply the funniest and shiniest film-comedy of all time... it's certainly on my personal top-ten list. This one also gets a solid ten on the voting scale. Millionaire heir, Arthur Bach (Moore), is a middle-aged 'child' who refuses to take the mature path in life and avoids all requisite responsibilities. He also refuses to leave the bottle. One day he and his personal butler, Hobson (Gielgud), go shopping at Bergdorf Goodman's and run into petty larcenist, Linda (Minnelli). Arthur and Linda's chemistry adds electricity to the rest of the film. There are hilarious set pieces aplenty. In one such scene, Arthur (drunk throughout most of the story) knocks on the wrong apartment door and receives ear shattering threats from a human 'siren' (""My husband has a gun!!!!). Performances by everyone involved should be duly noted: Geraldine Fitzgerald plays Arthur's loving-yet-ruthless grandmother, Sir John Gielgud almost steals the entire show with his acidic droll-isms (He took home the Oscar for this one), and Christopher Cross provides the Main Theme song (Oscar winner ""Best That You Can Do""). It's a shame the late Dudley Moore passed away last month (March 2002)."
0,"I ended up watching The Tenants with my close friends who rented the movie solely based on Snoop Dogg's appearance (a passionate fetish of theirs) on the cover. Understandably, I did not expect much. I thought the movie would include the typical array of Snoop Dogg related behavior and imagery often seen in cliché rap videos. However, my generalization was for the most part wrong. Unfortunately, this didn't make the movie any better.  Most would describe the movie as a dark serious drama, whereas I would describe it as a dark seriously drawn out boring drama flick. The film tells a story of two struggling writers (Dylan McDermott and Snoop Dogg) who are trying to create their own separate masterpieces. Their polar opposite lifestyles end up forming an unlikely but highly complex and neurotic friendship. This friendship moves throughout the entire movie like a wild roller-coaster - most of which is contributed by Snoop's character - reminiscent of someone with a severe case of split personality disorder. And although the movie is a drama, the acting - which has a morbid and serious tone - from Snoop and company was more comical than anything else.  I wouldn't recommend this movie for those who are attention impaired because this one has a lot of dialogue and a lot more dialogue after that. There are some mediocre conflicts, but even they are mostly bogged down with more dialogue. The end, however, jumped at me with a sudden surprise. It was a little bit twisted, somewhat unexpected and a perfect way to wrap up a movie that needed to end. While watching the ending credits I couldn't help but picture the director thinking, ""Oh God, how the hell do I end this snoozer."" By the way, the director laid out carefully planted hints and subtleties leading to the climax - all of which are more visible than Waldo in a crowded street of midgets wearing nothing but black sweaters."
2,"This film is really not for most movie goers. The pacing is extremely slow and the acting is robotic and two dimensional. It is the kind of film that you would expect to see playing in an art gallery where it would be appropriate to only watch ten minutes, and where you wouldn't have to sit for two hours waiting for a gripping storyline that's not going to materialize.   Fans of the genre can probably appreciate it as a parody (or may appreciate it for more complicated reasons) but it's unlikely to be worth your time if you're coming at it without the right background. Which would be most of us.  What I did appreciate about the film was the scene and decor, the primary colours, the furniture. It's perfectly staged to mimic some aspect of the 1970s, or 60s, although which aspect I'm not exactly sure, I'm tripping out of my area of knowledge here. But it's beautifully staged and it works as a series of individual scenes just as a full length film it is much too long."
2,"This movie truly seemed as if it were written by a pair of stoned fourteen year olds that just discovered softcore porn and boobs. To say that the humor was sophomoric is an understatement. There is no sign of intelligent life here; not that one would expect any. Yet slapstick humor serves a purpose and this title just falls short in every category. Nothing but crude and unfunny dirty jokes, sexually repressed writing and bad characters. The lead in this movie may just be the most unlikable character in recent comedy history. Somehow stalker tendencies turn into sweet nothings whispered into the ears of fourteen year old perverts in the middle of the most disturbing nocturnal emissions. Disgusting film with a ridiculous plot, pitiful and childish writing followed by terrible performances from actors portraying annoying characters. If you have any semblance of a brain, you'll do some good and stay the hell away from this garbage."
1,"Soylent Green I found to be an excellent movie.  If you like Logan's Run you'll like this.  Yes the movie is old and there are no special effects and some of the acting can somewhat be best described as ""cheesy"" but the story is excellent.  The story of how the world can be and its impact on society is very poignant.  At the end the mystery wasn't a mystery but the story unfolded in an easy at the right pace.  It's nearest modern day equivalent would be ""Dark Angel"" in terms of how the US is shown to be third-world country."
2,"I watched this movie because I was expecting to get an inside look into the real Charles Manson. I wanted to see if I could figure out why he did the things that he did and why in the world anyone would follow him.  This documentary begins with a very creepy voiced narrator telling you that basically this is Charlie's turn to explain things. All the songs in the film are very satanic. The whole thing has a very dark feel about it.  Charlie spends a lot of time preaching or teaching as he would call it. He compares himself with Richard Nixon and discusses how ""everyone has Lucifer inside of them"". The man really seems a mix of possessed and crazy to me. I did not really gain any understanding of why he did things that he did. I just got further proof that this person is exceptionally disturbed, not gifted as he thinks and as the film tries to persuade you.  The film takes you to the famous Spaun ranch and shows pictures of then and now. Charlie tells stories of the ranch and explains how his ""world"" is still there. He goes on and on about how he does not live in our world, he is above and beyond us. Our world and the United States is the devil, an evil machine.  I have watched a lot of documentaries about killers and criminals, trying to figure out why someone would do the things that they do, how they must reason it in their mind. This is unlike anything I have ever seen. At times, it is very boring, at times unbelievable. I got a very creepy feeling while watching it and confess, I did not finish the whole film. I lost interest in listening to Charlie rant and rave, he is clearly insane.  All in all, you get a feeling of perhaps what his followers heard and saw from him. I bet that his story has not changed much. It didn't make sense then, and it does make sense now."
2,"Being a fan of ""JAG"" and its topical stories, I knew that this show couldn't be that bad, but due to my work schedule wasn't able to watch it when the first season debuted. I finally got around to catching this show in early 04 and have been watching it ever since. I thought that ""CSI"" and its many versions was great--but ""NCIS"" is The Best! The chemistry between all characters is sooo real. ""CSI"" doesn't have that feel to me. Wonder what the next season will hold now that Kate is gone. Are we to see a more obsessed Gibbs, like he was before they found out who Ari was?! I hope so! And I hope they finally track down and kill that bastard Ari"
2,"this film is just flat out exotic in every sense. the period details and characterizations are perfect and the controversial erotic material well integrated into plot and pacing of the film.  the basic plot involves Maria DeMedeiros' character's affair with famous author Henry Miller (Fred Ward) and her attraction to his wife June (a smoldering performance by Uma Thurman.)  all of the actors and actresses involved do splendid work but it is the beautiful Uma Thurman who steals this film. she's only in the film about 25 minutes but those scenes radiate an eroticism that has been unmatched by any film since. she is simply gorgeous in this role and any person doubting her acting ability due to her poor script choices recently should check out her performance in this film.  the much talked-about erotic elements and explicit sex scenes that caused the MPAA to create the now useless NC-17 rating, are actually well integrated into the film and actually work to create better understandings of the 3 principle characters through their sexual behaviors and practices. the film isn't all sex like some people think, but when the erotic elements rear their head, the intensity and focus of these scenes throw people off kilter.  overall this is a fantastic film that drags just a little bit near the beginning and end, but is perfectly acted and stunningly filmed.  a great date film or for people who love truly great cinema.  rating:9.5"
2,"With out ruining all the films twists and turns (I recommend reading as few reviews as possible before seeing the film), this is a great little thriller. Very stylish cinematography and good characters. The twists (there are only a few, so don't let them be ruined by careless reviewers!) were unpredictable, mostly.  Great film, only complaint would be the very horror-slasher ending which left me a little disappointed given such an intelligent premise. And no I don't think that will ruin anything for the first time viewer..."
2,"***This review includes spoilers***  This dark, brilliant film has been much-talked about since its release in 1988, and for good reason: only a few films have such immutable power, leaving you with mental images that stay with you for months or even years. This film's austere ending is a commentary on the prevalence of heartless evil in our society. Reduced to its simplest expression, there is no joy in nature. Make no mistake, this is an ugly film that you will only want to see once. I cannot imagine anyone finding the same degree of stark satisfaction from the sanitized 1993 American version, complete with a happy ending tacked on to appease nervous producers. Please don't see the 1993 version.  Rex and Saskia are two young lovers on holiday, alternately loving and fighting as close couples are wont to do. Their flaws are revealed, making them more endearing: during the drive he becomes macho and demanding, while she rebels and becomes petty and shrill. After the fight, they are closer than ever. One cares about these characters, can imagine their lives together for years to come, possibly even getting married. She's earthy and fun-loving, while he is quietly appreciative of her company. Oddly, she presages the forthcoming events by recounting a strange dream about a golden egg. These two seem a perfect match. The sun sets on their short romance when they stop at a rest area and she disappears. He hangs around the rest area for hours, long into the night looking for her and trying to reconstruct her footsteps through the rest area. The sense of desperation and mystery lingers, and it shows in his pained expression. Anyone who has ever lost a loved one can identify with his quiet, desperate longing.  Several years later, Rex is still obsessed with Saskia's disappearance. His romantic partner, realizing that she can never take Saskia's place, walks out on him. Rex appears on talk shows, canvasses neighborhoods with flyers, and revisits their favorite places in an attempt to understand just why Saskia disappeared. This part is important: Rex wants to understand the nature of evil, and in order to successfully get through this film without lying awake all night with the ending forever running in your head, it's important to acknowledge this aspect of his character.  The film cuts to Raymond, the man who kidnaped Saskia: you might have imagined a raving maniac, but instead you see a gentle, kindly older teacher with a wife and son, living in a well-appointed flat and driving a Citroen; he might just as well be Pere Noel on summer holiday. This film is constructed like a crime scene investigation. First we experience the disappearance firsthand, and then we go into the mind and life of Raymond, showing how he coldly planned and carried out the kidnapping with as much emotion as changing the oil in his car. It is this two-part process which slowly builds the powerful suspense in this film. We see how methodical he is in his approach to the planned kidnaping, and, impossibly, we even laugh at him: looking for a victim, he inadvertently makes a pass at a young woman he knows, and she calls him on it, saying that he should be ashamed of himself. It is this twist of fate that drives him to kidnap a young woman from the rest area, where no one is likely to know him. So the fates have brought him Saskia.  Aware of Rex's obsession, Raymond offers to meet him in a public place and show him what happened to Saskia. Suffice it to say that the mystery of Saskia's disappearance is frighteningly revealed at last; listen closely and you can almost hear God laughing in the soundtrack. Because of the strong ending, I would recommend seeing this film with at least one other person.  There is nothing beautiful about this film; it is cold, ugly, and unfair. At the very least, maybe it will help you to understand the unreasonable nature of evil."
2,"I loved the story told in the TV series and felt each of the characters was interesting and believable. Sam Loggin was a super Lucy! I thought Gus was suitably sleazy, and Daniel was a decent guy with his true qualities not evident at first. The 3 girls at Lucy's flat were each definite characters with good story lines of their own and their interactions reminded me of some of my experiences with a roommate. The office life portrayed was realistic and very funny! Each character was a clear individual and well-portrayed by the actors. I saw the show before I read the book so for me this show IS Lucy Sullivan. I read the book afterward and noted a number of differences from the TV show but felt the show still stands as a brilliant entertainment in its own right. It remains one of my favourite TV series and I'd love to watch it again if someone airs it again or if it comes out on DVD."
2,"S.F.W. the concept was interesting the plot once watched was lame and boring a true waste of a casts time and a industry's money.  Once you see it you will soon forget it!!  Stephen Dorff & Reese Witherspoon just waste there time & talents in a really wasted script. With a better more talented screenwriter and a more talent director the movie could have been so much more mabey even some underground cult film. But what happens to a story about 5 people that are being held hostage in a convenience store for 36 days, & one of them demands from the hostage takers that all TV-stations should broadcast the entire situation live, turns into a boring little movie with nothing more than a loud soundtrack and really bad over the top acting in a really bad made for Tv movie of the week for the big screen.  Whats funny is that Reese Witherspoon is billed as a main character, she is on the cover of the DVD box but she is hardly in the movie, and when she is on screen she shows what talent she does have, but how much of it is wasted.  Stephen Dorff is a great actor, another of the under-rated talents in Hollywood today who seems to find really bad scripts that just really under-rate his talent and ""S.F.W."" is just another film that is a big mistake on his acting resume.  Rounding out the rest of cast that sseem to waste there talents is both Jake Busey and the very laughable not so talented Natasha Gregson Wagner.  One film I'm adding to my ""Worst Films of 1994"" list!!!  See it once, if you don't fall asleep, and once the credits roll you will soon forget it."
2,"I think this an excellent program, the power of this show is not the visuals (CSI looks 'smoother, cooler') but the characters really work great together. All very different people, but with a magical chemistry between them. I personally very much like the character of Abby, and the interaction between DiNozzo and Todd (I know she isn't in the series anymore. but we here in the Netherlands haven't got to that point yet). All in all it is one of my favorite shows, and it sure as hell beats CSI, if you ask me, but then again ""its a matter of taste"".  The fact that it focuses only on the 'naval criminal investigations' maybe limiting the possibilities of where the producers can go with the show, without going 'over the top'. Then again, if you were to let the show be about any sort of murders, on any place they might also be tempted to go over the top. Lots of things to think about, and enough things to there may be wrong or weird about this show, but the chemistry works. And it is that working chemistry that I think makes a good show."
1,"I'm normally a sucker for romantic films which are well-filmed and well-acted out. This is a romantic (period) film set in 17th-century Italy, but filmed in French with English subtitles. The fact that it is a period film means it will inevitably be slower-paced than films set in the modern day era, so it Will bore some. If you can overlook that fact, it is actually a really good film. The scenery, the costumes, and the cinematography are beautiful, and the main actors and actress are very compelling in their portrayals, projecting the intensity of the emotions that are running through the plot. The story is like a sad love story with an unhappy ending. Its easy to believe that this is an accurate portrayal of the real-life characters. In spite of the fact that I was really moved by the main characters and the storyline, I decided to check out the validity of the story and found out that the main theme of the movie's story - that of an sad unfinished love story - was completely fabricated.   In real life, Artemisia was raped by Tassi initially, rather than submitting to his advances willingly and passionately as the movie had portrayed. She continued to have sexual relations with him only because he had repeatedly promised to marry her. When they were in court, he had *not* admitted guilt of rape out of pity for Artemisia's torture (unlike what the movie portrays). In reality, he had tried to portray Artemisia as a loose, promiscuous woman with insatiable sexual urges. In the movie, his sister testified in court that Tassi had a wife and had sexual relations with his sister-in-law, and Tassi's character was all the while made to appear as if his sister had been slandering him regarding his alleged affair with his sister-in-law (although he admits to having had a wife back in Florence). Needless to say, in reality it wasn't really like that at all. In fact, far from it. Tassi was really responsible in the planned murder of his wife, whom he had begotten from rape. And to add to that, Tassi really had sexual relations with his sister-in-law, impregnating her in the process, but all this wasn't really mutual as well - again, he had raped his sister-in-law before.   So now we have a clear picture of the real Tassi as a multiple sex offender, what do we make of the film Artemisia's portrayal of him as a lover? We take it as an attempt to make this movie into a romantic film... that this film was never made to be historically accurate... Apart from these points just mentioned, there were other historical inaccuracies like in its interpretation of Artemisia's art (in real-life, she was never really influenced by Tassi's painting style, and she was actually considered a much better painter than Tassi ever was.) One thing remains true and its the fact that Artemisia Gentileschi has been credited as the first woman painter in history, and although her mastery of the art rivalled many of her male peers, she had always experienced difficulty in getting enough credit for her work because of her gender as a woman, in 17th century Italy.  Enjoy this film for its own sake, for it is a pretty good romantic drama, but take its historical references with a grain of salt."
1,"TRICK OR TREAT is a fine example of Hollywood jumping on the ""backwards messages in metal music"" bandwagon that Tipper Gore and her Washington Wives kick-started in the mid-'80s (other, less successful entries in this mini-genre include the awful BLACK ROSES and silly THE GATE). I was a sophomore in high school when TRICK OR TREAT came out and couldn't wait to see it. It seemed to disappear from video stores by the end of the '80s, but I finally picked up a budget-priced DVD copy a short while ago and it brought back many pleasant metal memories from back in the day. Any teenage metal nerd could relate to the trials of Eddie ""Ragman"" Weinbauer (Marc Price of ""Family Ties"")in this film as he is persecuted by the preppie ""beautiful"" people in his high school for his heavy metal fashions and musical taste. Eddie's favorite rock star is Sammi Curr (who looks a lot like Tommy Lee of Motley Crue), who is killed in a hotel fire early in the movie. Eddie is inconsolable till he receives a test pressing of Sammi's final, unreleased album from a radio DJ (Gene Simmons of Kiss in a brief cameo). Eddie soon discovers that this LP, when played backwards, allows him to communicate with the undead spirit of Sammi Curr himself! Soon Sammi is giving Eddie advice on how to get even with his preppie torturers but when the messages escalate in scariness (""Waste'em ALL... no false metal!"") Eddie tries to destroy the album, which results in Sammi coming back to life via Eddie's stereo speakers. Sammi rampages to the big dance at Eddie's high school and takes the stage to rock the crowd and disintegrate a few unlucky ""false metallers"" before Eddie arrives to save the day and the girl of his dreams. (SIGH) No, it's not terribly scary in 2006, it wasn't even scary in 1986, but TRICK OR TREAT is a movie that will bring a smile to the face of any 1980s metaller and has a kick-ass soundtrack courtesy of the cult band Fastway. Well worth seeking out if you've ever banged your head or have a taste for B-grade horror movies (or both, like me)."
2,"I have never been compelled to write a comment about a movie before this, and in fact, the very first comment I ever saw on IMDB for this movie (at the time, it was the only comment and is now the last comment) was pretty spot on (the one where the person saw it with Finnish subtitles). However, now that his comments have made it to the back of the queue, and since I just saw this movie AGAIN on TV (on the Action Channel) a few days ago, I thought I'd chime in. The comments about this movie having the feel of a bad porno are spot on.  I have not seen Gigli, and probably never will, but I can't imagine it is NEARLY as bad as this movie. Like the subject says, I have seen A LOT of movies, and none have been even CLOSE to this bad.  That said, this movie is like a trainwreck. It's so horribly bad, you can't turn away. I even encourage my friends to see it. It's horrific on every level, yet somehow compelling!"
2,"The ever underrated Polanski and one of his most underrated and overlooked films. Many have cited as possible reasons the director's difficulties with the US authorities but equally it must be said this is difficult territory. It would be convenient to consider the narrator and his wife to be a couple who simply took their sex games too far and then got their inevitable comeuppance. What we are forced to participate in here, however, is the very ebb and flow of love and lust between two people not afraid to let their passions take them to the edge and even over. The moral of this tale is not that men are evil bastards and women cruelly treated but that we all have those dominant and submissive elements within us that we can use for fun or for real. In the early stages Oscar revels in playing the humiliated one, later the tables turn and finally turn again. Everybody has been known to take a sexually orientated or humorously intended remark or game too far and can surely recognise the elements displayed here even if they are written rather larger than we are used to. A passionate, moving and insightful film."
0,"I have seen over 1000 movies and this one stands out as one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. It is a shame that they had to associate this garbage to The Angels 1963 song ""My Boyfriend's Back."" If you have to make a choice between watching this movie and painful dental work, I would suggest the dental work."
2,"PANDORA'S PARADOX is a great film that crawls under your skin without the help of dialogue. It uses the universal visual language of cinema to tell a tale of secret desires, control, manipulation, death and rebirth. Good and evil are not portrayed as opposing values, but as the reflection of each other, bouncing over Matthew Saliba's carefully developed characters. For the viewer, the film feels like it's 10 minutes long. If I judge by its reception at the Fantasia International Film Festival, film goers love it. Matthew Saliba is a talented filmmaker and I hope he will continue exploring symbolism and metaphors in cinema and continue to develop his unique style. His blend of personal, yet universal issues and crude (in your face) treatment with wild, creative imagination is not ordinary fare. This makes him an extraordinary filmmaker."
2,"'De battre mon coeur s'est arrêté' ('The Beat that my Heart Skipped') is another superb and delicate character-driven film from French writer/director Jacques Audiard ('Read My Lips') and his collaborator Tonino Benacquista. How this director can take such potentially fragile subjects and create enormously powerful and indelible characters would indicate that he is one of cinema's truly important artists.  The story evolves as Thomas Seyr (Romain Duris) is seen as a member of a real estate scam working with smarmy associates who buy and sell buildings at the expense and eviction of poor tenants. The work is distasteful but Thomas is following the lead of his father Robert (Niels Arestrup), a man on the skids who depends on Thomas to do his 'collections'. Thomas loathes the work but is devoted to his rundown father. We discover that Thomas' mother, a former concert pianist, is dead when Thomas encounters his old piano teacher who urges him to practice despite his ten year absence from playing and to audition for a new career. A light of hope goes on in Thomas' psyche and he is lead to a Chinese immigrant pianist Miao Lin (Linh Dan Pham) who takes him on as a pupil to prepare him for his anticipated audition.  As Thomas practices, his world of crime does not abate and he is intermittently pulled away from his passion for the piano by his old partners as well as his father's continuing need for his 'dirty services'. He is torn between the life he has been leading and the promises of a career with his mother's (and his) passion for beauty in music. When the partition tenuously separating these dual lives is broken, Thomas struggles to find his way back to music. The ending is unexpected and keeps in step with the verismo of the screenplay.  Romain Duris is a major talent and delivers the kind of performance that indicates he is becoming a powerhouse of an actor. But the real star of the film is the director who knows how to relate a glimpse of a man's life in subtle, quiet ways despite the accompanying background of violence. It is a delicate balance and Jacques Audiard makes it work. Highly recommended. Grady Harp"
2,"When I first watched this film in 2005, I loved it, although at the time I was perhaps ready to agree that the second half of the film stumbles in a lot. But having recently seen 'Camera Buff' by Krzysztof Kieslowski, I am absolutely convinced 'Torremolinos 73' was inspired by it, in one way or another. This is not to deny originality to Berger's creation, but the acquaintance with the Polish film can seriously help understand and evaluate 'Torremolinos'. It can let us appreciate some details (compare, for instance, a cameo appearance of another Polish filmmaker, Zanussi, in 'Camera Buff' to the ever-powerful presence of Bergman's loudspeaker in 'Torremolinos'), but, most importantly, it allows to see, what exactly the subject of the film is. If our understanding is not informed by 'Camera Buff', then 'Torremolinos' is a vinaigrette of politics, porn and art-house cinema. If it is, then the main topic is exactly the one that makes the film somewhat 'heavy' in its second part and which was one of the central topics in Kieslowski's film. Cinema becomes a wedge, which is hammered between the routine and creativity. Aspiration to make 'serious' films and the cherishing of a film as one's child violently confronted the parental responsibilities of Kieslowski's protagonist, who gave in to creative impulses. The conflict in 'Torremolinos' is slightly reversed in that cinema becomes a more complex agent: it is the reason for misunderstanding, but it also unveils the problem and in the end even helps to resolve it. It is nevertheless the importance of the choice and its connection to various problems concerning family life that bring a kind of dullness into the second part of 'Torremolinos'. In this case it might be useful to agree with those who call this part 'subtler' in comparison to the upbeat start. In particular, this second part contains an easily-unnoticed topic of how much insult the male pride can take, and whether or not it is worth being guarded when love is at stake."
2,"Has a number of scenes that easily meet requirements to be spoofed by MST3K. Best example: Landau throws a child-like temper-tantrum in the control center, threatening not to come back until he has full control of the goings-on. Plus, a lot of the dialog is simplistic, cartoon-like, i.e. not very realistic at all. There are a number of fallacies and absurd situations: 1) Connery says the 5-mile meteor will have the power of 250,000,000 tons of TNT (or 250,000?); either way that would be an understatement. But okay; I'm nit-picking, 2) Less nit-pickingish is calling the potential impact (only!) ten times stronger than the strongest earthquake; it's more like a million times stronger, 3) It's impossible to redirect a meteor when it's only days away from impact (again, nit-picking, or maybe they didn't know that then - though I doubt that), 4) it isn't possible to destroy a meteor that big (and that fast) with a series of nuclear hits, 5) One of the space centers only discover a big one going towards NY when it's just minutes away from impact! What were they doing, sleeping? 6) And does it have to hit NY of all places? Why do these meteors and asteroids always aim for the well-known cities? 7) It should have been more devastating; they showed it's impact to be more like that of a huge earthquake than a meteor, 8) the absurdity that governments would actually think about politics when the future of the entire planet is at stake - and that they actually need convincing that warheads need to be used?! The film is also quite slow."
2,"Only amusing thing about a made for TV-drama is how you can be given a list of 5000 titles and easily sort it out. If you want to see that actress from ""8 Simple Rules"" show that really she wasn't acting at all, that's what she actually looks and sounds like, this might just work out fine for you. So this girl (who looks pretty anorexic, but that seems okay in this movie) wants to make a documentary about fat people from roughly seventy points of view. She (poorly) dresses herself up as someone fat and gets humiliated with the weakest fat jokes ever written. They're not even mean really, they're just painfully lame. Menopause is seriously uninspiring. I guess it's still better than the endless stream of my husband is a monster because he only takes me out once a week and even had two beers last Christmas-flicks but man is it close. We even are insulted with some pointers about how not to get fat, like not eating pizza and stuff. Take notes.  Edit: I do love how the genre section somehow includes ""horror"" though"
2,"What a confusing, weird, Horror movie this is! The director was obviously on drugs but who can explain the editing mess? The editor was probably very high when working on the final print. I mean, there is no coherence between most events and it's like you are watching 5 different movies, in the style of ""Crash"" or ""Amores Perros"".  The sad truth is that this failure is considered as a Slasher movie with dramatic over tones. It tries to be like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" but with an 80's slasher feeling. It just doesn't works.  The acting is atrocious, not to mention the horrible direction that looks like an amateur flick. The only good thing about this one may be the soundtrack which is fairly good and fits with the movie's weirdness.  This movie is well known among B-fans as the movie where the killer uses a Richard Nixon mask.  Plase avoid this bizarre mess! It's just too bad to be bad."
1,"Ordinarily I really enjoy movies like ""Chances Are,"" but I wasn't quite satisfied with this one for a few reasons. The first half was pretty well done overall, with Alex Finch dying and being reincarnated in a new body (played by Robert Downey Jr.). He meets up with his wife (Cybill Shepherd) and friend (Ryan O'Neal) and his daughter, who is now grown up. The scenes with them meeting again and Downey rediscovering who he once was are well done, and there is a good amount of emotion and happiness once Shepherd finally believes its really her husband reincarnated, but from there the film goes downhill. There are several sex-related scenes that turned me off completely, especially Downey and Shepherd wanting to get together again despite the difference in their age now. After that, however, the film manages to end in the most satisfying way possible, considering the circumstances of the plot. I was disappointed because I did not expect the film to become so immoral by the end. There was great potential with this story, and the scenes in heaven are well done. There is a good theme song sung by Peter Cetera and Cher, but ultimately the film is not great. For a better, similar film, try ""Heaven Can Wait."" Decent, but I really kind of wish I hadn't seen it because of the scenes in the second half.  *** out of ****"
2,"Prior to watching this film, I'd never heard of it, so I didn't know what to expect (I hadn't read reviews or anything). My initial thoughts were that it would be a bit like another Danish romantic comedy, ""Italian for Beginners"", which, while I thought was a great film, was a bit bleak for me. Hence, I wasn't really expecting much more from this one.  However, I must say this is probably one of the best films I've seen over the years - much, MUCH better than the similar Richard Curtis efforts such as Four Weddings or Love Actually. The chemistry between characters is electric and, while it is arguable that the film is a little contrived with an oh-so predictable ending, it's very much a ""feel good"" film. The supporting cast are great - especially Mgala (she only has one word throughout the film, and I won't repeat it!) and Mulle/Merete, who you just feel sorry for.  The only problem I had with this film was that the Italian character, Sonny, was a complete caricature - big bushy eyebrows, lots of hand waving, and, when he broke into Italian, used the most obvious Italian phrases (""Ti amo!"", ""Scusi!"") - I guess it's because he was played by a Swede rather than a ""real"" Italian. The acting was fine, just a bit too contrived.  If you can find a copy on DVD, grab it. The version of the DVD I purchased was from Denmark itself (I speak a little of the language), and I was rather surprised and disappointed to find that there were no English subtitles (only those for the three Nordic nations) - I'm sure those outside of Scandinavia would find this a fantastic film, so I cannot understand why such an opportunity was missed. Incidentally, however, the film has been remade using English actors for the British market, as ""The One and Only"" but is, as far as I can tell from IMDb reviews, is a terrible effort."
2,"After the first two films, with their lavish sets, excellent acting, and state-of-the-art CGI, this comes as a massive disappointment. It's an ultra-low budget animation, so poorly drawn that it looks like a rough draft rather than a finished animation. The cast who played the Little family in the previous films return to voice their characters here, but the dubbing is so haphazard that you'll swear that different actors were used. The plot is paper-thin, the jokes are mostly lame, and even the very young are likely to get bored well before the end. A great shame, as the first Stuart Little in particular was a great hit with my daughter, and one of the best children's films of recent years. Stuart Little 3 is, however, best avoided."
2,"""I fight! I love! I conquer like a Barbarian!"" Sound like something Yul Brynner might say? Nope, it's just the Duke, wearing a scraggly Fu Manchu mustache and seemingly painful eye appliances for that Oriental look. Yes, pilgrim, get out of town when the Conqueror rides across the steppes of.....Utah? This film is so ludicrous that you will howl with laughter.   And the Duke isn't the only object of derision. Susan Hayward of the flaming hair and milky skin as the princess who is the object of his desire couldn't be more wrong in that role. You expect her to whip out a cigarette and give forth with some snappy dialogue. Dialogue???.....did people ever really speak that way? Somehow I think not. I'm surprised MST3K never did this film but maybe it's funnier without added comment.  I cannot imagine what the director Dick Powell was thinking? This was a man who made some wise decisions in his long career; unfortunately this was not one of them. Maybe the answer lies in the fact that Howard Hughes who was not noted for his wise decisions was the head of RKO at the time.  The down side of this film is the fact that the majority of those involved were all stricken with cancer possibly as a result of filming in an atomic/hydrogen bomb testing ground. Whose decision was that?"
2,"This movie had so many chances to be comedic, dramatic and even interesting, but just failed on so many levels. In some instances the actors were so ""acting"" that it was just unbelievable. Nothing good here. Joey Lauren Adams is just good to listen to because she is a bit sexy. Hell it is so bad that I just saw the end and I can't remember how it ended... I had to make this comment at least 10 lines for it to be posted. Now, you have to know that I am just writing to get it posted. This is how bad this movie was. If you get stoned or do some LSD, it just might be your cup of tea. If you have the brain power to dissect the movie. Even then, don't expect too much."
0,"Why were there so many people crowding into an evening showing of Roberto Moreira's ""Up Against Them All"" (""Contra Todos"") at the San Francisco Film Festival? ""It's about a hit man,"" my friend said. ""Well. . . and it's Brazilian,"" I added. Beautiful multicolored people, tropical weather, lush rhythms, and a hip gangster plot? Ample enticements no doubt.  Somebody forgot to tell us one little detail: this is a very bad movie, really pretty horrible, and as unpleasant to watch as it is poorly made.  So how on earth did ""Contra Todos"" get to make the rounds of Berlin, Melbourne, London, Manila, Stockholm, Cairo, Chicago, numerous smaller local festivals, and now San Francisco? Apparently, because of the way the promotional process and the film festival circuit work.  First of all, it won first prize at the Rio Film Festival where it was called the best Brazilian movie of the year. It must have been a bad year; they've had much, much better ones. Next, snappy synopses in catalogs plus imaginary buzz lead to crowded auditoriums and -- since the movie isn't featured anywhere and so avoids close scrutiny by critics -- it keeps going the rounds.  Festival blurbs aimed at promotion sometimes goose it up a lot. A Chicago Festival one called ""Contra Todos"" ""a speedball cocktail shot straight out of Brazil"" and referred to Claudia's s boyfriend as the ""stud of the slum-like neighborhood."" Soninha is ""Teodoro's nymph-like teen-aged daughter of burgeoning sexuality."" The movie is ""shot with the urgency of a frequently hand-held camera"" and the director ""works up a genuine and palpable sense of frustration borne from domestic desperation and decay."" The effect is "" unbearably raw and honest,"" and the movie hurtles ""toward a conclusion as dead-ended as the lives on display."" Not the best writing, but it sure pumps up the excitement for a certain kind of potential viewer.  ""Contra Todos"" does concern a hit man, two hit men actually, and a wife and daughter and a born-again Christian girlfriend. It's shot -- in execrably ugly digital video with no talent behind the camera-work -- mostly in a barren-looking poor suburb rather than in one of the teeming ""favelas"" or village-like Brazilian city slums where such wonderful films as ""Black Orpheus"", ""Pixote,"" and ""City of God"" were made, and not in Rio this time, but São Paulo.  The hit man with family problems is Teodoro ( Giulio Lopez) and his partner with a drug problem is Waldomiro (Ailtan Graça). Both actors have a little TV experience as does the actress who plays Teodoro's sluttish blonde wife Cláudia (Leona Cavalli) and Silvia Lorenço who plays his pouting, ready-to-revolt daughter Soninha. These actors might make it through the back corners of a few telenovelas. Who knows? -- in a better directed film they might even be good. Aside from them there are some young men who get bumped off by Teordoro or, when he's busy, gangs of thugs. The principals don't work up much presence, even though the camera magnifies their pores.  A couple of observers, one at the Berlin Festival and one at London's, did see this movie's failings but alas they're buried in the Web hinterlands. Henry Sheehan noted from Berlin that the ""film"" (his quotes) was ""the worst of the video works"" shown. ""The filmmaker seems to have chosen video simply because it was a cheap alternative to film,"" Sheehan wrote, ""and hasn't made any creative use of the new medium"" -- nor, he adds, done anything else creative.  Sheehan pointed out the movie's first big mistake: it ""starts off as a domestic drama that's supposed to ratchet up when, half an hour into the action, Moreira reveals that the father and one of his friends are professional hit men. Waiting the thirty minutes adds nothing to the movie; it seems like a perfectly arbitrary decision and is, at the very least, a waste of time. But ratcheting up is all Moreira ever does, like a little kid who's gotten a tool kit for his birthday, and goes around banging everything in sight without rhyme, reason or skill."" Devastating, but true.  Writing about the 2004 London festival for Kamera.com, Metin Alsanjak tried to look at the positive side but nonetheless gave away the lack of redeeming features in calling the performances ""easily the film's best feature."" Yes, very easily, given that everything else is so bad. Alsanjak admitted that "" this low-budget, violent and seedy account of the lawless in Sao Paulo is devoid of any likable characters, and as a result, of hope. Too dark and cynical to be a telling account of the human condition, the film is not helped by poor subtitling.. ."" Alsanjak's connecting Contra Todos to ""Dogme"" and Mike Leigh didn't help matters.  Apart from that meaningless first half hour in which nothing redeems the boredom of our wait for the first acts of violence -- which, when they come, are just ""banging everything in sight without rhyme, reason or skill"" -- Moreira clumsily tries to redeem his abrupt finale by adding what appear to be outtakes right after it, followed by an implausible ironic concluding scene where one of the characters gets married. No doubt the director wanted to exhibit the ""banality of evil"" of low-level hit men in working class neighborhoods, but he can't make the characters, which he sees generically, come alive for us. And the structure of the film shows that he also can't edit his material.   (Seen at the San Francisco International Film Festival on April 28, 2005.)"
1,"This movie was made in Hungary i think. anyway,the countryside is gorgeous,the people who play the farming folks were totally fascinating. their horsemanship is awesome. I got more into the native people, the farm life, and how heroic they were trying to hide Brady from the evil Nazis who where looking for these parachutists. They even sacrificed their life in several instances. the young orphan lad that Brady befriends was a sweet kid. you will marvel at the riding i think, and the action of trying to evade the Nazis. it is entertaining and comic in some spots and very tragic in others. Ladies have hankies handy, as you will be devastated at the end. i own it, and have watched it several times. in other words, not just a one time around flick. its a keeper...."
2,"Think about it...this movie is supposed to be about an outbreak of killer frogs. So is it any surprise that the movie is a laughably bad film? They weren't exactly trying to make a remake of Romeo and Juliet here! One of the biggest problems I initially saw (aside from the horrible over-acting of Ray Milland and the dumb plot) was that despite the title, the film has very few frogs. Most of the killer animals were actually toads, lizards, tarantulas, snakes, birds and alligators. Aside from gators and a few of the snakes, which were poisonous, it just seemed ludicrous seeing these totally harmless creatures supposedly on a mad killing spree--though none of them actually did a whole lot other than just hop scamper about--after all, they are just cute little critters.  Some of my favorite stupid deaths in the film was one where a guy seemed to be killed by Spanish moss and tarantulas. Aside from a few chigger bites, I can't see how Spanish moss could pose any health problem and a tarantula bite is about as bad as a bee sting! Another had a man killed by bottles of various poisons which cute little lizards pushed off the shelves in a nicely choreographed scene (though none of the reptiles were killed--they just scurried about the dead man's body). Another scene featured a man getting bitten and dying from a rattlesnake bite in less than 3 seconds. And my favorite was when the guy wrestled with a gator--and if you looked closely, you could see that the animal's jaws were taped shut!   From my description, you'd probably assume this was a terrible film--and it is. However, like many of the animals running amok films of the 50s, 60s and 70s, it is also strangely watchable because it is so silly. Many won't enjoy this campy a film, but bad film lovers will have a ball. If you like this wretched 70s film, also try EMPIRE OF THE ANTS (which is actually worse than FROGS) and NIGHT OF THE LEPUS (about killer bunnies). Don't say I didn't warn you!"
0,"Normally I wouldn't feel qualified to review something I only saw a half hour of, but I'll make an exception for this one.  Let the dialogue speak for itself! Here's some of the bad guy's lines: ""I smell...teacher!"" ""Sorry, teacher! You get an 'F!'""  Bad guy and bad girl ( right after killing 2 cops and stealing a van full of drugs, they're getting hot and heavy):  Him -""So how do you feel about shooting some innocent bystanders?""  Her- (purrs) ""You sure know how to show a girl a good time..."" One generic kid who ran for his life instead of helping someone, gets to sum up his life and personality in this line -""I AM a CHICKEN-TWIT! (this was the USA network version) My old man was right! No wonder he left us..."" Boo-hoo.  (Not actually a spoiler ) Bad guy (on fire) screams ""Aargh! Fire!"""
2,"True, Evil Altar has its share of imperfections and flaws. Some viewers may be turned off by the lack of originality or by a few technical problems, but I certainly wasn't bothered by these imperfections during the screening of this movie. Evil Altar is a story of Reed Weller, a sorcerer, a warlock and Satan's faithful servant who likes to torture and sacrifice unfortunate kidnapped persons in his barn. In the beginning of the movie, even before the titles, Reed Weller assigns an unfortunate boy suspended from the ceiling to collect a hundred and three children that should serve as offerings. Then, the evil man cuts the boy in the chest and informs him that his soul may be taken away any time. Apart from kidnapping and sacrificing people, Reed Weller also likes to boast and he does so by stating his power is absolute. Self-confidence is what I especially liked about this bald-headed character... Thirty years later, the kidnapped boy still roams the countryside in order to collect one hundred and three children. He is known as The Collector and he's ugly as hell. One day, he whacks a local kid over head with a baseball bat, and that's where real problems begin. Up to this point, The Collector was supplying Weller with kids from other towns since local kids were of no use to Weller. When a lawyer from the city stops in Weller's town, The Collector strikes again and abducts the lawyer's son. The plot thickens. The Collector is shot down by a local girl during a hunting accident. In his sack, a curious surprise is hidden. The girl's father calls the cops, the local sheriff appears, and the viewer immediately gets the impression something's not right here. Indeed, the sheriff is in league with Weller, and so is about every man and woman in this town. The plot is really quite complex for a b-flick. As it is revealed later, a number of townspeople made a pact with the devil in exchange for a little favor. These poor fools are now completely under Weller's power. When the sheriff notifies his master of the hunting accident, The Evil Man resurrects The Collector, and sends him out to haunt the girl who had the nerve to mess with Reed Weller. The girl, her brother, the brother's girlfriend and the lawyer searching for his son all have to face the powers of darkness in order to save their souls... Evil Altar offers not only this intriguing plot but also some blood, especially near the end of the movie. In one scene, The Collector visits the poor girl who shot him, pulls a bullet out of his guts a gives it to her as a souvenir. There is also a man with a hatchet embedded in his back, one throat slashing (not too convincing, I'm afraid) and one nice stunt involving The Collector being set afire and thrown into a swimming pool. One complaint about the ending: With regards to Reed Weller's assertions concerning his absolute power, it seems to me that The Evil Man was defeated too easily in the finale."
2,"This is a documentary which pays homage to the pure mayhem and fury of the myth/man Bruce Lee! Moreover, it contains the most astonishing scenes from the Game of Death. It shows the scenes how Bruce intended them, and I must say it is awesome to say the least! Whereas the original Game of Death movie almost even manages to ruin the Bruce Lee material (not to speak of the rest of the movie, which is worthless) this new material is mindblowing and real! For example, you can see the Korean Haikido masters lips move in the original Game of Death but there is no speech! Here you hear what he says, and you hear Bruce Lee's comments and thoughts. Such as: ""Give him the fatigue bombing!"" and wonderful dialogue such as Karim: ""You must have given up the hope of living"" ""On the contrary, I don't let the thought of death bother me"", and ""I hope you don't mind that we move our man so the two of us have more time to groove!"" Moreover, they call each other ""baby"" all the time. It is truly awesome. The rest of the biography is also good but what makes this a real classic is the remake of Game of Death."
2,"I have numerous complaints about this film but most importantly I did not like the characters and did not understand their feelings, motivations or actions. The was no advancement of the plot or resolution of any issues. My interest in the film was only slightly raised by the interaction between Ribisi and the father. I am treating the 90 minutes I spent watching this as a ""what not to do"" primer for my own screenplay."
2,"One of the greatest movie ever made. This movie was written directly for the screen by Neil Simon, and his mastery of creating a hilarious but also surreal story perfectly works in this uproarious comedy. The luggage sequence, being dumped down in the middle of the central park, breaking off the tooth scene, to name a few. Two main characters, namely George and Gwen Kellerman, are played best by always-wonderful Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis. This movie could have been just a stressful and noisy film without their lovable chemistry. I heard Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn are now remaking this movie, I don't know what kind of success the new version will get, but I am sure, by all means, they can't even get close to the quality of this original one(the original was in the early 70s, and its now 90s!!). So, whether seeing the new one or not, see this one first!!"
2,"*this review includes spoilers*  Ah, Squaresoft, until 1997 you were nigh-infallible. You had created the great RPG Chrono Trigger, which is almost certainly one of the all-time best RPGs. You had created the first six Final Fantasy games, all of which deserve a place in the pantheon of video gaming (and number 6 can compete with Chrono Trigger for the head seat at the table).  Then the time came to leave the Super Nintendo for the Playstation. You took the big step.  And tripped, horribly.  You got so caught up in the new, grander visuals you could create that you forgot to concentrate your resources on things like ""plot"" or ""character development,"" the two key elements in making your previous games great. Even your marvellous composer Nobuo Uematsu got swept up in the techno-fever; his FF7 soundtrack can barely compare with his for FF6.  In many great pieces of literature or film or video gaming, the villain is the best (or at least, most outstanding) character. Just look at Kefka in FF6; he stole the show. But Sephiroth, the villain of FF7, is really the *only* character; the rest are cardboard cutouts given three-dimensions physically, but not emotionally or spiritually. When you killed off Aeris, I was supposed to feel sad; instead I was bored. The deaths in FF6 were much better handled.  Unfortunately, the masses were hypnotized by the pretty pictures and bought the game in droves, leading you to think you had created a good game. Thus we got an abomination like FF8, which lacks even a good villain. Fortunately, FF9 and FF10 each were better than the previous, leading me to hope that you're recovering. And Chrono Cross, the sequel to the aforementioned Chrono Trigger, was a very good game indeed (save the ending). As was Final Fantasy Tactics, which had notably 'poorer' graphics but a much better storyline and more realistic characters.  With any luck, you'll soon return to your former level of greatness, and FF7 will be remembered not as a classic, but what it truly is: a mistake."
0,"It was obvious that this movie is designed to appeal to the Chick Flick audience, to which i have sat through quite a few and enjoyed most. However, this was a very irritating attempt by Heather Graham to become the next Meg Ryan ( who became annoying as hell in her own right ). Her acting was overdone and it appeared that she was overanxious compared to her colleagues who were relaxed in their roles. This film might have been more, as there was suitable budget for settings, actors and a decent story line. My wife and I both agreed that this was 'Muck' at the end, as the film ended on a painful embarrassing high! Better luck next time, hope Miss Graham sticks to the type of films that she belongs in like From Hell."
2,"The 1947 mystery-thriller,""The Two Mrs.Carrolls""is considered by many critics to be a tepid,unrealistic film and one of Humphrey Bogart's lesser works. This couldn't be more false. The film contains brilliant performances by Bogart and Barbara Stanwyck,a great deal of eerie suspense,and delicious bits of English humor. The plot of the film is similar to that of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Dial M for Murder"" and ""Suspicion"",but has a uniqueness all it's own. It tells the story of Geoffrey Carroll(Bogart),a struggling artist who marries a wealthy woman,Sally(Stanwyck), after his supposed invalid wife dies. Life is normal for them,until Sally begins to feel ill and restless quite often.A doctor says she's suffering from nothing more than a nerve condition,and she believes that's all it is. She is, unfortunately, in for a big surprise.She learns from Geoffrey's precocious,young daughter,Bea(Ann Carter),some things about his previous wife.For starters,she was not an invalid and only got sick the last few weeks of her life.Geoffrey gave her milk at night to make her feel relaxed.This is exactly what he does for Sally.She also learns that a painting of his former wife,called ""The Angel of Death"",was done while she was sick. Hearing this,Sally comes to the realization that she is Geoffrey's next victim of a well-planned crime.Stanwyck has never been better as a panic-stricken wife,trying to survive her husband's evil doings.Bogart gives a highly underrated performance as a psychopath,who gets brutal when his murder plot doesn't go according to plan.His presence on screen is often frightening.The ending is wonderfully witty and comical.While not in the same league as ""The Maltese Falcon""or ""Key Largo"",this is still a highly entertaining Bogart film,that will not disappoint. I give it a strong 8 1/2 out of 10.  "
2,"This could have been a great movie had the end been different. It is just too much America over it (the ending). I would have been more satisfied if the final had been another and in the same line as the rest of the movie, but maybe if it would, the spectators would have not been so many?  Nevertheless, Samuel L. Jackson makes a good appearance in a film that was always going to be very good directed by François Girard with the sounds of Esa Pekka Salonen and Joshua Bell (solo violinist).  I loved the costumes and makeup for the 18th century part which happened to be the best part, I reckon. Obviously from my comments above, I liked the last one the least. The ending is not poor, but I felt it could have been done better with a more satisfying outcome.  You will be enlightened should you decide to watch this flick. It has an outstanding beautiful sound track. I recommend this to anyone."
2,"Seven years ago, when I was in high school, I was assigned to read and study John Steinbeck's 1937 novella, ""Of Mice and Men"", in my English class, and it's no surprise that I still remember it clearly now, as it's not a story to forget. Shortly after reading the book, we were shown the 1992 film adaptation in that class. I first heard about this much earlier adaptation of the book around that time, but it took me seven years to finally get around to watching it, even though I had been intending to watch it for quite a while by the time I did. I knew this version was widely praised, which gave me fairly high expectations. It may not have fully met these expectations, but if not, at least it came very close, and I would say it's just as memorable as the book.  In the 1930's Great Depression era, George Milton and Lennie Small are two migrant ranch workers in California who dream of having their own place someday. Lennie is big and strong, but he is also mentally handicapped, and George has to look after him. He means well, but often gets into trouble, doing things he doesn't realize are wrong, and George is always the one who has to get him out of it. After leaving town to escape from a mob started by Lennie feeling a woman's dress, the two of them soon get jobs on another ranch. Here, their co-workers include Candy, an elderly man who won't likely be able to work on the ranch for much longer, and Crooks, a crippled black man who faces discrimination because of his race in this era. The ranch owner's son is Curley, a belligerent young man who hates Lennie from the moment he first sees him, and has a lonely wife named Mae, whom he tends to neglect, but doesn't want any other men to have anything to do with her, being the jealous type.  The cast really helps carry this film, including the two co-stars, Burgess Meredith as George and Lon Chaney Jr. (the son of the ""Man of a Thousand Faces,"" Lon Chaney) as Lennie. Both of these actors fit their roles well, and are both memorable. Chaney's portrayal of a mentally handicapped character may not be flawless, but it's still good. Most of the other cast members' performances also stand out, and it helps that they were clearly given a good script. There are times when the score doesn't fit the scene very well, and there may be certain other slight flaws, but they are far from enough to ruin the movie. In addition to the acting and script, there are a number of very interesting characters, several of whom one can easily sympathize with, and some very well crafted heartbreaking scenes, starting with Candy losing his dog. The score in these scenes does fit them well. This adaptation of Steinbeck's novella was also very nicely filmed.  This first ever film adaptation of a John Steinbeck story is not perfect, but overall, it's still very good, and very faithful to the book. It does take some liberties, such as giving Curley's wife a name, and they obviously left out some detail, but the differences are minor, at least for the most part. Anyone who has read the book knows that ""Of Mice and Men"" is not a cheerful story. It's a tragic drama set in a tragic era, and this movie is much the same as the book, so keep that in mind if you're planning to watch it. If you're an emotional kind of person, you could easily find tears in your eyes at times, and if you're not, you could still at least come close to tears. If you've read the book and were impressed with it, and/or you like dramas from the classic era in general, I really think this 1939 screen adaptation is worth checking out."
2,"Im watching it now on pink (Serbia TV station) and I must say this is a crap. Shallow, no acting, effects too sloppy I mean, who made this series?  This was a stupid attempt of the Studios to make some more money on the success of the film. OK. The film was great in 1994 when it came out. But the series?  Some times you can see how idiotic the lines are in the speech of the characters. I mean, did they actually pay someone to write that, was that someones relative at the Studio? This is no SciFi.  The film was the bomb, the series suck."
0,"I first saw this movie on MST3K. And although I laughed my posterior off at the jokes, I don't particularly think this movie was all that bad. Sure it was a little hard to understand it is quite obviously low budget, But it had a very Hitchcock-like plot and I can honestly say that when I viewed the non-MST3K version, I was genuinely entertained. This movie is crying out for a Hollywood remake."
2,"The plot: the earth's tectonic plates are all screwed up, and a colonel has to place a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles to set the plates back the right direction. Other than the obvious fact it was inspired by ""Armageddon"", the plot has potential.  But there's theory and there's practice. And the actual movie is really messed up. There's a pause every five minutes for a speech about fathers abandoning daughters. There's a military man who wants to stop them, although the motive is really fuzzy. There's a romance that is never carried out. The fate of the 8 million or so LA residents is never mentioned. Basically, this film is full of subplots not fully explored and then ends very abruptly. It was like a novel ending mid-sentence (not unlike Douglas Adams' ""Salmon of Doubt"").  There were some good parts. The teenage girl, played by Raine Marcus, was a great choice. Beauty, brains, strong driving character. And she runs into a very unexpected turn of events when trying to escape from LA (if only Kurt Russell had been there). And John Rys-Davies is in this film, so that's good. I think maybe there was a line or two of dialogue I liked, if that counts.  So, yeah. Unfinished plots. A ripoff of Armageddon. Too much moralizing about the wrong things. And one big non-stop advertisement for the Blackberry (that Palm Pilot thing). Remember kids, carry a Blackberry on you at all times just in case you're knocked unconscious and kidnapped by a deformed serial killer with a love for fanatic Bible-thumpers! This film, obviously, is not recommended."
2,"It's not that this is a terribly awful film, but it would take at least some effort to view it at this point. I tried numerous download sites, checked websites after i read favourable right ups. It is not worth the effort.  A sub standard, weak, predictable and at time plain awful plot, bad acting, no real threat. Save your time and do something more productive.  I would recommend that rather than watching this you spend the time looking for other, better, films to watch.   If you've somehow stumbled upon this title, the odds are you will find another one that's much better in no time."
2,"This project, along with Emma Thompson's reimagining of ""Sense and Sensibility"", both filmed in 1995, contributed to the renewal of the popularity on both sides of the Atlantic of Jane Austen's work and the costume drama that the British Television and Film Industry does so well, and for good reason. The talent involved - Colin Firth, Jennifer Ehle, Crispin Bonham Carter, Benjamin Whitlow and the wonderful Barbara Leigh-Hunt on the acting side, Jane Austen on the writing side, and the BBC on the production side - almost guarantees a quality production, but as this is, in my opinion, the best Austen dramatization yet to appear on film or television. Of course, having the luxury of being able to basically shoot the novel without abridgement (327 minute mini series) is an advantage that this production has over the filmed versions, the most notable of which was the 1930's production with Sir Laurence Olivier as Darcy.  Surprisingly, the most effective casting was perhaps Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet, an American playing the famous English Rose. For pure enjoyment, Benjamin Whitlow and Alison Steadman's comedic performances playing off each other as Mr. and Mrs. Bennet was a real highlight. Also, it is no mystery why Colin Firth got type cast as Darcy  he appeared earlier in the costume drama Valmont, but he seems to be most remembered for this `Darcy'; he seems to be made for this role (wasn't it amusing that his character's name in `Bridget Jones Diary' was `Darcy'?)  Anyway, this is a wonderful production and I can't think of any significant critism so for me, this mini series is a close to perfection as Drama can get on Television."
2,"This was very very boring and lame, this should need some more happiness, kindness and entertainment to make it a great movie for all ages because it's about like 2 very clever kids who really know a way to save Christmas and escape a evil dark attic in an old crooked house and like every 10 or 20 minutes, the young kids keep returning to the attic. This movie is not really a Christmas movie, it's more like a dark nasty movie that makes it more like a Halloween movie like the attic and cave parts and stuff Even when I was 9 year old little girl I didn't like this. The music was great but the whole movie was just bad. The script was like out of the brain thing that even a 2 and a half year old probably wouldn't really like. I wasn't interested in the storyline either and some parts of the cover is unfair and incorrect, Jill had on a blue and white dress in the cover, but in the movie, she has on a type of Cinderella dress? Although she does look kind of cute in it and all she is one of my top cutest cartoon characters, but hey? Some of the characters look uncute and ugly, but whatever the movie is just plain weak and boring."
2,"A bank heist goes horribly bad when (what else) the dead come in for food.  As far as recent Urban Zombie movies go, ""Dead Heist"" is better than ""Zombiez,"" but worse than ""Hood of the Living Dead"" and ""Gangs of the Dead."" That's not saying much, especially when you consider the fact that ""Hood"" and ""Gangs"" are bad movies too.  The dead here are cut from the same cloth as the speedy zombies from the ""Dawn of The Dead"" remake and the infected from ""28 Days Later"" and it's sequel, only generic instead of interesting or frightening. The gore is nothing new, though the fact that the dead can only be killed by being shot in the heart (and you're to blame...) is a poor attempt at trying something different.  As far as acting goes, Big Daddy Kane does the best job. He's not good, mind you, but he does the best job. Amusingly, while Bone Crusher and E-40 are advertised as staring in it, yet they aren't in the movie for very long-Bone Crusher appears in the beginning as a patron in a strip club so tame it could have passed for MTV's ""The Grind"", then disappears. Meanwhile, E-40 has less than 5 minutes of screen time as a porn director, and gives a ""alright, where's my paycheck already"" level performance. The rest of the cast ranges from a dead ringer for Vin Diesel to the white female cop, a white businessman thinking of joining the Nation of Islam (ha ha), and plenty of stereotypical gang banger characters.  While not the worst recent Urban horror movie, there's still nothing worth recommending here. I have no idea whether or not the fact that this reminded me of the ""Attack of the Street Pimps"" bit from ""Hollywood Shuffle"" is a good thing or a bad thing. It's probably a bad thing."
2,"At first I thought, ""what did I get myself into?"". Twenty minutes into the movie and I started looking at my watch and wishing that I wasn't here. I didn't come all the way to Hong Kong to watch a crap Kungfu movie! Then all of a sudden Ka-POW! Talk about being worth the wait. DragonBlade is a roller coaster ride with a long way up in the beginning. And as we all know, the further up that roller coaster goes... the bigger and more exciting that ride ends up. I just can't imagine anyone getting the total impact of the fights without watching it on the big screen the fights are so in your face that it absolutely pulls you in. So worth seeing."
0,"I have been looking for this film for ages because it is quite rare to find as it was one of the video nasties. I finally found it on DVD at the end of last year it is a very low budget movie The story is set around amazon jungle tribes that are living in fear of the devil. Laura Crawford is a model who is kidnapped by a gang of thugs while she is working in South America. They take her into the jungle Laura is guarded by some ridiculous native who calls himself ""The Devil"" she has to go though all unpleasant things until they are happy. Maidens are Chained up. The devil demonstrates eating flesh in a horrible manner. Peter Weston, is the devil hunter, who goes into the jungle to try and rescue her,"
2,"This has to be one of my all time greats despite its cheekiness and poor model reproductions of oil rigs! Its still captives me every time after having seen it possibly more than 30 times, if anyone reading this could explain the scene to me where Harald (cramers No.2 guy) says that it feels like the last minute and asks about the escape plan. I would be grateful as I have never understood this scene. The film on the whole is tailor made for Roger Moore and he fits into the quirky character like a glove and it is also very ironic that he buddies up with the American ""Mr. King"" who plays the production platform offshore installation manager as Moore also stars with the same actor in many of his James Bond movies. I think the part of Cramer (Anthony Perkins) was played brilliantly with special focus on the ""flip outs"" that he performs when he begins to realise that his master plan isn't exactly going to plan. All in all a top movie despite what most of my friends say!"
2,"What can I say about this movie?It's simply an utter garbage.The plot is completely idiotic(the killers roots on the loose)and the acting is lousy beyond belief.The special effects are laughable,the gore is non-existent.Very similar to ""Seedpeople"" but even worse.So if you are a fan of sheer stupidity rent this in pair with ""Sorority Girls and the Creature From Hell"".I am sure,that you'll laugh till it hurts with this turkey.Otherwise avoid it like a plague."
2,"This is one of those films that plays out exactly as you might expect, almost by-the-numbers. A young couple get arrested for selling 'dirty pictures' (one of the titles for this release) although the pictures sometimes show nothing more than Ornella Muti naked in a photo-me-booth. They end up in the mansion of a rich lady (Irene Pappas giving a performance less lively than some of the furniture and obviously wishing she were elsewhere) because they run out of gasoline, and when she finds them in her garage syphoning off some fuel she realises she has a use for them. Anybody who doesn't realise what she is up to in about five minutes could only have seen ten movies in their lifetime. It plays out like an old episode of the TV show 'Thriller' with some nudity added (though Pappas obviously has a body double) and some hippy/flower-power shtick thrown in replete with cheesy music which is probably the best thing in this predictable yawn of a movie. Only of interest to Ornella Muti fans if they're not above barely-legal leering."
2,"I watched the first episode out of curiosity, but I really did not expect to like it. Even with such great actresses, I thought it would probably be stupid. But once the first episode was over I couldn't wait to watch the next one, and it's continued to be that way! These women lead such exciting lives, and their love for each other is so refreshing to watch. This show is about what friendship is suppose to be, and rich people with seemingly great lives have problems too. I'm also really enjoying Andrew McCarthy's character, Joe! He's a billionaire that can be very romantic, but he also has issues. This is a very enjoyable show!!!"
2,"This film is absolutely awful and a good example of what dire straits the horror genre was in around this time. It's got the stock characters of the bullied nerd and the cruel gang of'punks' that pick on him and an abysmal storyline about a horoscope phone line that kills people; and that the recorded message talks directly to the characters doesn't phase them at all.I had the misfortune to sit through this some time ago so cant remember too much about it, but I suppose that's my point. You may think this is a 'funny' bad film , but in fact its just plain boring. It was dragging on and on at snails pace punctuated by a series non shocking/exciting moments and when I looked at the clock I couldn't believe it had only been on for 45 minutes. I'm always one for sitting out a bad film but decided to cut my losses and go to bed. OK, I know this isn't much of a review as I haven't actually watched it all, but this isn't much of a film either and unless its got the biggest midway change since 'The Jazz Singer' then I can safely say don't watch this film."
1,"Director Vincenzo Natali first showed his penchant for character-based sci-fi flicks with his 1997 short film ""Elevated"", wherein 3 people remain trapped in an elevator while unseen monsters roam the building. His follow-up feature project ""Cube"", released later that year, had a very similar premise, this time with 6 people and instead of an elevator it was a vast expansion of interlocking cubic deathtraps. Both were admirable attempts to take the sci-fi genre a step further, by deliberately declining to show almost any visual stimulation, choosing instead to spend as much time as possible focusing on the human element, how the characters act, react and interact under incomprehensible and dangerous conditions. After his exploration into the mainstream with 2002's ""Cypher"", Natali has come back to his bizarre character-film trend to bring us ""Nothing"", his latest, and by far most optimistic and comedic take on the wide cinematic world of ""What If?""  Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) are life-long friends, brought together by a mutual detachment from society and a lack of any one else to be with. Dave, who has always been hindered by a selfish and somewhat dimwitted nature, lives rent-free with Andrew at his ill-located and ill-constructed house, where he often takes advantage of Andrew's neurotic and antisocial mentality. Despite all this, the two misfits are happy together, until one day their deep character flaws, coupled with some astronomically bad luck, land them in the middle of some pretty serious, jail-sentence-worthy trouble. On top of this, they discover that their house has been deemed unfit for existence and is scheduled to be demolished before sunset, so in the hazy, nightmarish panic of everything going wrong for them, they wish that the whole world would just disappear. And it does.  Going any further with the synopsis would compromise a lot of the film's slow (occasionally too slow) reveal about what's happened to Dave and Andrew, and how they deal with their new reality. Natali's fascination with studying human behavior under duress (ala The Birds) is here in spades, but simply by making the main characters friends rather than strangers, he's able to break away from the thriller-horror element of this premise to open it up to a more comfortable and optimistic level. It's almost as if he's made the aphoristic opposite of ""Cube"".  Of course, the film is not 85 minutes of laughter and sunshine. In keeping with fundamental realism, our two anti-heroes' dynamic often becomes antagonistic, sometimes with rather nasty results. Like the ""Desert Island"" game, the film looks at how even best friends, when left alone together, can fall apart, but at the same time it shows that friends are vital to the quality of existence. In a very twisted, sci-fi way, this is a feel-good flick, with good heart and good intentions.  However, there are a few qualms to be had with ""Nothing"". While the two lead actors, Hewlett and Miller, do well with their parts, their characters are not nearly as interesting as they should have been, considering it is completely up to them to entertain us for the better part of an hour. There is some development in the relationship and personalities of Dave and Andrew, some background is given, but ultimately not enough. A generous viewer will sit through the less-engaging portions of the film to see it through to the end, but cynics will probably give up pretty fast.  Acting, as mentioned, is adequate, and considering the amount of 'green-screen' work that would've been needed, reasonably convincing. David Hewlett and Andrew Miller, who both wrote co-wrote the screenplay, have been long-time friends of Vincenzo Natali: Hewlett has in fact featured in every film Natali has made. Perhaps it was their creative input that steered this film in a more positive direction. Nonetheless, the story could have been a lot more involving. Granted, it is relatively entertaining considering that (no pun intended) nothing really happens, but you get the impression that, in more experienced hands, a lot more could've been done with this premise.  In all fairness, ""Nothing"" is an impressive piece of work in many ways. The concept is interesting, the direction is inventive, the script works on a human level and, most of all, it shows a progression in Natali's creative mentality. For fans of his work, this will be a delight, and for others it will be a nice way to pass a little unwanted time. It's just a shame that the director's fixation on human drama prevented it from being the great, fun film it could have been."
2,"Pretty Peaches is difficult if not impossible to find in a British video shop. New video censorship legislation in the mid-80s saw to that. It goes further than most adult films of the period in pushing out the boundaries. After 1984 it was beyond the boundary.  You don't often hear of a film featuring explicit treatment of enemas. Pretty Peaches did. Every other scene in the film, mandatory orgy included, fades from the memory long before that particular episode dims. The plot is of course secondary to the main action, but the story of the girl who suffers amnesia following a road accident is novel and also helps to make this a cut above the ordinary. See it if you get the chance."
2,"OK, I know that this movie is based on a play, but still, does the main idea expressed by Peter Gallagher need to directly reflect a line said by John Cage on Ally McBeal 3 years later? Gallagher's character says that while he experiences this ""fantasy"", he is happy, happier than he is in the real world. John Cage tells Ally that you can't find happiness in the real world, and that is why she is only happy in her imaginary world. Hmmmmmmmm.... This seems a little redundant to me, but as long as we don't see the ghost of Happy Boyle on Ally McBeal, I can forgive DEK.  As for the overall movie, I give this movie an 8 out of 10 stars."
1,"This movie was like any Jimmy Stewart film,witty,charming and very enjoyable.Kim Novak's performance as Gillian,the beautiful witch who longs to be human,is splendid,her subtle facial expressions,her every move and gesture all create Gillian's unique and somewhat haunting character,she left us hanging on her every word.I should not fail to mention Ernie Kovacs' and Elsa Lanchester's highly commendable performances as the scotch loving writer obsessed with the world of magic(Kovacs) and the latter as the lovable aunt who can't seem to stop using magic even when forbidden to.The romantic scenes between Stewart and Novak are beautifully done and the chemistry between them is great,but then again when is the chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and any leading lady bad!"
2,"I had to press the return function of the remote control when I believed to hear that Paul Gégauff, main actor and writer of the novel which is the base of Chabrols ""Une partie de plaisir"", says about his wife: ""She sides with Korzybski who claims to refuse Aristote, but she hasn't read either one"". I heard right. Although I had mentioned polycontextural logic in a couple of my comments, I would have never expected to find it actually in a film - and here we are.  If you reject Aristotelian logic, you give up the whole fundamental of our thinking. With the logical categories of position and negation, also the corresponding ethical categories good and bad are abolished. In such a world everything has to be defined newly, and most things are not anymore either good or bad, but both good and bad or neither one for which a term has still to be invented. I have no idea how Gégauff came to the idea to introduce the founder of General Semantics, Alfred Korzybski, in this movie. However, one could imagine that Korzybski's most important mathematical feature, the ""multi-ordinality"", is seen here as the metaphysical principle of the open marriage structure of the couple which finally leads into one of the most brutal catastrophes ever seen in a movie. The concept of multi-ordinality replaces unambiguous mappings through ambiguous ones - yet, not in a chaotic, but exactly restricted sense. Possibly, in the eyes of Gégauff's character, his wife breaks out of this restricted area when she goes into a sexual relationship with Habib. Gégauff's character says clearly: ""Earlier, she preferred sublime culture, and now she is wallowing in the mud of human scum"". (By the way: Also the highly sophisticated language which Gégauff's character uses in order to damn every lower level of human existence into hell, shows a philosophical background which is hard to find anymore.) Thus, his wife crossed the border restricted by the Korzybski-functions and is to be condemned because of that. Up to this moment, Gégauff's character still appears as the guardian of a consistently valid metaphysics; e.g., to his future new wife he underlines many times that he feels freed and relaxed. So, the real breaking-point in the story of this movie is there, where Gégauff himself abandons his own metaphysical principles. From his unreachable position, he comes so-to-say down and turns into a vulgar stalker and beggar who is ashamed about himself. However, the story seems to trespass another border, too, namely the border between Gégauff's character and Gégauff, the writer, himself. In the movie he (almost?) kills his wife on a cemetery, in his real live (just a few years after the movie) he was stabbed to death by his second wife, on Christmas' Eve. Therefore, the final question arises: Does the reflexivity which arises when somebody plays himself still belong to Korzybski's principle or does it violate this principle, because self-reflexivity is excluded in a multi-ordinal world?'- It is."
2,"I saw the movie and I can't say that ""7 Seconds"" is one of my favorites, but i enjoy the scenes from Bucharest. I was amazed seeing ""Palace of the Parliament"" the second large building after Pentagon, and other buildings. It's a nice movie on this perspective. Specking about the script, I can't really say it's original or very fascinate, they must to improve a lit a bit the scenes. That's my opinion; I hope you can make an idea about the movie just reading my little article or maybe you will be more interest by some details about the film or the places where they turn. That's my firs comment, but I hope it's quite good."
1,"An unexpected pleasure as I had heard nothing about this film.  Shameful since it warrants having a wider audience.  A wonderfully humane story with a social message gently told, although admittedly predictable in its resolution. Solidly acted by the principals. Beautifully photographed with muted colors floating against grey that captures the nostalgic tone of the film.  My recent foray into Chinese film (Shower, The Road Home, Not One Less) has been an exciting one that I hope to continue exploring. China and its people is an amazing canvas for film-makers. ""The King of Masks"" can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone similarly interested in recent Chinese film.  "
1,"okay, but just plain dumb. Not bad for a horror/comedy film. I was reading how people switched it with the Michael version and that is a good trick in my opinion because some grown ups hate horrors and when they see this one it will get them interested in horror films like this one or maybe (never seen it) the horror (possibly comedy) uncle Sam, i'll have to see about renting or buying that film but the 2nd is way better then this one but i bought this one on VHS of Amazon and got it November 21, the day before thanksgiving. worth the four bucks, l.o.l. at this film.  9/10"
2,"A lot of people who have seen this film will wonder why 10 out of 10.  However, having watched this film almost 12 times I never tire of it. Ridiculous quotes and incredibly bad acting from all involved make it so much fun. And this is what movies are about right? Simple setup - Roger Moore and Michael Caine's ex-partner conman characters are almost identical to two partnered scientists - HOW CONVENIENT! And so they set up a plan to steal the scientists secret diamond stash all the time bumbling through some goofy moments in order to set up the crime.  Written by the creative team behind the dire TV sitcom ""Birds Of A Feather"" I was surprised the film has some quick witty one-liners. It also has some cringe inducing scenes including what I believe is Roger Moore trying it on with his own daughter. Michael Caine is the first to point out some of the terrible films he's made so you can't really have a go but his accents are hideous.  All in all I recommend this film to anyone who just wants a laugh even if it is at the expense of two fine actors.  ""Has anyone ever said you look like Mel Gibson?"" Baddie shakes head. ""I'm not surprised."""
2,"Duke Mitchell and Sammy Petrillo were a low rent Martin and Lewis. Mitchell had a some talent while, judging from this film, Petrillo had less then none. Petrillo is so bad, so annoying, so painful to watch, he takes Jerry Lewis' schtick to lows one would think were not possible. I had never watched this movie from start to finish until recently laid low by an illness, and all I can say is it made me sicker. Don't get me wrong I love bad movies but this is something else, or Sammy is, since if one could remove him from the film then you'd have something someone might want to watch. He doesn't speak he growls or whines in a way that I can only compare to a petulant child does moments before he's sent to his room until he's 40.(His parents should be held accountable for crimes against humanity for not eating their young)  How many people saw this and asked for their money back?  After seeing this I must take back anything I've ever said bad about Jerry Lewis, since as annoying as he can be, at least he is funny.  The plot has something to do with Mitchell and Petrillo ending up on a jungle island where they meet Lugosi (Half an hour in and after bad Petrillo mugging and a well sung but badly written song) who wants to do experiments on the pair.  Truth be told as long as Petrillo is silenced this is a good grade z movie, but he's as bad I have to put this with the lowest of the low.  One out of ten, because I can't go lower."
2,"I'm not entirely sure I understood the plot of Sukiyaki Western Django, mainly because I couldn't understand the dialogue very well, but I still can say it's unlike anything I have ever seen. In a time when ridiculously unoriginal films are hailed by critics and average viewers alike, it's great to see something truly different come to the screen. Sukiyaki Western Django takes the oldest subgenre in American cinema, the western, and spins it until it is original againand it works.  I have never been a Takashi Miike fan at all, honestly. I have only seen this and Audition, but Audition was boring and cliché enough for me never to give him a second thought. Sukiyaki Western Django, however, shows his true capability as a director and that he isn't just another run-of-the-mill carbon copy like I originally thought after viewing Audition.  Sukiyaki Western Django is very dialogue heavy, but it still packs a lot of action and a lot more character deaths than is standard for this type of film. People are calling this movie gory, but it isn't. The blood is pretty generic and typical, though maybe a little more than your standard action flick. This didn't really disappoint me as much as it does in other movies, because blood isn't really needed in Sukiyaki Western Django. It carries itself with style and a lot of intense action.  I think the reason this film is getting so many negative reviews is because people don't get it. You really have to be a fan of the genres it imitates to understand it fully, even though the plot is simple. Two rival gangs, and one man, a gunslinger, they both need. The rest is a mix between action and art that simply stunned me. The town itself is so diverse it almost becomes its own character, and in a way it is. The aesthetic of some of the action scenes go so much further than the typical slow-mo Matrix rip-off you're used to and really creates a style all its own. The technical beeps in the background gave off a really cool surreal, modern feel that isn't overdone or annoying.  The acting worked for the genre, even though most of it is terrible and hard to understand. The entire Japanese cast, minus Tarantino, worked because they all spoke English, which just added to the cool-weirdness. I'm sure if your high school English class tried to analyze every figurative detail it would take weeks. Just put it this way: as far as the formula goes, Sukiyaki Western Django is both original and complex to the point of insanity. I simply cannot understand how this is by the same man who wrote/directed Audition.  Overall, I'm going to quote something I heard someone say after they viewed Sukiyaki Western Django: ""Well, that was different, but I wouldn't call it entertaining."" That is the view a lot of people are going to have, and I can't deny people will think that just because I personally disagree with it. It comes very close to being too top-heavy with aesthetic for its own good, but, for me, it was still very entertaining and awing. I can't say anything else except that you need to see this and make up your own mind. It is original, that's not my opinion, and if you're like me and enjoy more than the typical Hollywood movie you MUST see this. If you can care less about originality and just want another typical western you've seen time and time again, don't bother.  It really matters what your opinion on entertainment is. But I loved it.  8/10"
2,"Holy cow...what that guy ""AussieStud"" from Providence said...really, REALLY awful. It's shot on video, it looks cheap, the acting is terrible...nothing to recommend this movie at all. Get some porn and be done with it...seriously, both the acting and the production values will be far superior to this dreck. I simply cannot say how rotten this movie is. I tried to find one performance that wasn't painful, but failed.   The actor who plays the lead is hot. The ""hustler"" is really not attractive enough to be worth all the trouble he causes. A bad, bad movie, proving that gay men need to demand a little bit (well, a lot) more quality from their artists.   Did I mention it was awful?"
1,Simon's best comedy is superbly crafted by director Gene Saks and given life by the immense talents of Lemmon and Matthau. No one delivers these lines better. No one times them better. Nobody does it better.
2,"John Wayne as Ganghis Khan, and lots of white people playing Asians and making no effort to look and sound Asian. The Duke was a great actor, but a 6'4"" white man with blue eyes doesn't make a convincing Asian. Give him a much shorter Mexican brother, Jamuga, played by Pedro Armendariz, and a barely 5 foot mother who was only 7 years older than the Duke, Hunlun, played by Agnes Moorehead, and you have The Conqueror, one of the grossest examples of miscasting in Hollywood history. The other big f-up is the semi Biblical English dialog. If you just have to see this movie, and it is worthwhile for laughs if nothing else, get the DVD and turn the captions on. Otherwise you won't have clue what anyone is saying.  The basic plot is actually pretty good. The stunts and battle scenes are good too. If it had been cast correctly and if the Biblical dialog had been eliminated, it could have been a good movie.  Although never intended to be a comedy, it comes across as one, largely due to the ridiculous dialog and costumes, especially head gear. Agnes Moorhead's costume is especially hilarious, wrapped up like a mummy in green with only here face visible and huge multicolor beads dangling from each side of her head. Susan Hayward, who plays Bortai, Temujin's love interest, looks like a modern prostitute, in a succession of low cut dresses and modern high heels. Also included is a Las Vegas dance revue of scantily clad white women who have these things on there heads that look like pink doggie-doo. During the opening credits and later during the first battle, John Wayne is seen charging into battle on horseback, waving his sword in the air, and screaming like a Commanche with an expression of shear insanity on his face that had me busting at the seams. William Conrad plays Kasar, Temujins immensely strong but retarded brother, and plays it HORRIBLY. John Hoyt plays the Shaman, dressed in a white and yellow Merlin costume, the character is the stereotypical Japanese from WWII movies.  Much is made about the fact this movie was filmed in SW Utah, about 100 miles or so from the Nevada Test Site which lead to the cast and crew being radiated and dying from cancer. I my opinion, this is grossly exaggerated. The facts are a lot of people die from cancer, actors included, and cancer has many causes. Also many of the deaths occurred decades after this movie was made and most of the actors lived into old age. This movie was filmed in 1954, but John Wayne didn't die until 1979. Several of the players survived him including, John Hoyt, William Conrad, Peter Mammokos (who is still living 50 years later), Chuck Roberson (stuntman, no screen role in this film), and the Duke's son Pat Wayne, who still lives. Las Vegas is about 100 miles from the Nevada Test Site, it hasn't died off from cancer. Several small Nevada towns, Tonopah, Goldfield, Beatty, Indian Springs, and Pioche, are literally next door to the Nevada Test Site, and they haven't died off from cancer either.  This is generally regarded as the Duke's worst movie. Although this is definitely a bad movie, at least it is entertaining. The Fighting Kentuckian, the Fighting Seebees, and The Green Berets are all much worse, they are unwatchable."
0,"I get to the cinema every week or so, and regularly check out this site, but never before have I felt compelled to comment on a film.  To my all time list of shockingly bad films - Last Man Standing, Spawn, The Bone Collector - I can now add the drivel that was 'Hollow Man'.  From the awful opening titles - a ridiculously over-long run through of cast and crew put together with alphabetti spaghetti - through to the insulting finale - a world record number of cliches and some of the most absurd dialogue and acting to have ever made it to cinema - this film is dismal, and only the impressive computer graphics keep you from walking out long before the end.  This isn't just my opinion - it was that of my friends, and everyone around us. When large sections of an audience are laughing and groaning during and after a serious thriller, its clear that the film is hopeless.  Not only that, it was sick too. The director took the action beyond the bounds of realistic fare for a violent film, and into the realms of an over the top blood soaked B-movie. It's difficult not to imagine the director as some sort of dirty old man, because the extent of the invisible man's forays out of the lab and into the outside world extended only to two attempts at having a feel of some breasts. Perhaps sex could well be the first thing on a bloke's mind if made invisible, but aside from the aesthetic pleasures of the ladies involved, it hardly makes entertaining cinema.  [spoilers follow]  Get past the films sick exterior, and things are even worse. Whilst Kevin Bacon does a good job of acting increasingly twisted as 'hollow man', the rest of them - perhaps handicapped by a dire script - do an even better job of being hollow cast. One long time member of the team is found strangled in a locker by the invisible man, ""He's finally snapped"" shrugs one colleague without a hint of emotion. This is par for the course, and the lab team swing between sheer terror and complete indifference with such speed that you wonder how they got into acting. They pad their way through the lab corridors terrified, guns poised, but then seconds later one of the crew skips happily off back down the corridor to get blood for a hurt colleague. The lead female treats the invisible man with courtesy and good humour even after he's insulted and abused her, and there seems to be little reaction to his breakouts, even after he drowns the Pentagon chief, ""He drowned in his pool last night"" reports the same female, spectacularly failing to put two and two together.  The script is littered with this kind of badly acted pedestrian dialogue, and the rest is just an A-Z of film cliches, which get laid on thicker and faster as the film progresses to the point of complete disbelief and amusement at the end.  The 'eureka' moment at the computer, the female undressing at the window, the looped security video - the list really is endless - the predictable disregard for strength in numbers, the decision not to kill the two main stars but just put them in a place of probable impending death and leave them to their own devices, the almost-dead good guy appearing out of nothing to save the woman, the bomb and ubiquitous countdown timer, the fireball explosion which just burns up before reaching the heroes, the falling lift which just stops before hitting them, and more than anything else, the immortality of the bad guy.  The invisible man is burnt to a shred with a makeshift flame-thrower, electrocuted, whacked round the head with a bar which had just sliced straight through one of the lesser actors, and then having apparently survived the explosion, fireball and total destruction of the labs, has more than enough life left to climb up through the fireball for one last pop at the films heroes - by which stage the disbelieving audience are cringing and looking at their watches.  That this exceptionally bad film actually made it to the cinema is astounding. Even the name of the film is as hopeless as the movie itself, and not even impressive special effects come anywhere near saving this one, which should be avoided at all costs."
2,"Very slow moving and hard to make it through. It never explains the back story and important details. Instead, the viewer is led on the typical ""seperate and get killed one by one"" type deal. That's about all this movie offers, no real plot, no gore.  The werewolf is barely shown at all, that is effective only if there is any REAL suspense. If the acting is bad, you don't care about the characters, and it's genuinely not scary then at least you should get some cool werewolf/gore/kill scenes. None of that is present in this movie.  If you can find anything at all better to watch, I wouldn't recommend this one."
1,"Felt it was very balanced in showing what Jehovahs Witnesses have done in protecting American freedoms. It also showed the strong faith of two families who were first generation witnesses. I also appreciated how it showed how by becoming a Jehovahs Witness affects non-witness family members and how hard it is for them to accept the fact that they don't celebrate holidays, the sad part is that non-witness families do not think of having their witness family over for family dinners/visits or give them gifts at any other times but for holidays or birthdays. When it comes to medical care the witnesses want and expect a high standard of medical care, what people forget is that blood transfusions allow for sloppy medical care and surgeries whereas bloodless treatments causes the medical team to be highly skilled and trained, which would you prefer to treat your loved ones? I highly recommend this video!"
2,"I saw this movie when I was around 13 years old.I felt the movie seemed a bit like a ""movie of the week"".  The only great thing about this movie was the intro at the beginning and the theme of the movie.  The intro (beginning credits) was a scary cartoon done in shadow.In the cartoon you see a woman giving birth to a baby to be quickly taken away by the ""devil"" who then eats the baby! Very strange to say the least.I tried to get the soundtrack on CD but I had to settle on getting a 12 inch record.  When it came on DVD,I bought it just for the intro!"
2,"Gary Bakewell is really trading in on his resemblance to Paul McCartney being as this is the second time that he has played the man. He also does a credible job at it.  The title of this movie is a little deceiving as it doesn't really tell the story of Linda, but more about her marriage to Paul. There is only one mention in this movie of her famous vegitarianism and no mention at all of her animal rights advocacy. It is a shame as these are some the things that defined Linda as a separate entity from Paul.  The love story between them is, as always, inspiring and Elizabeth Mitchell does a good job as Linda. While the flow of the story is a bit disjointed, there are some funny moments in the script as well as some revelations about her pre-Paul life (sexual encounters with Jim Morrison and Mick Jagger) that are interesting none the less. If you want the real Linda story though, you may have to get it from one of the bios written about her but not this movie."
2,"Unique variation on The Most Dangerous Game has quite the interesting twist..the prey is an attractive and NAKED stripper(..who becomes stuck in the position of dancing in front of bar slobs due to a run of bad luck). Reluctantly, she responds to the advice of a roommate, for a little extra cash, by getting in the car with a stranger she meets in her club, attempting to back out, but her choice of a pick-up was lousy..an expert hunter, who has graced the cover of magazines devoted to the sport, who likes to hunt down prostitutes on the side! When she attempts to escape from his jeep, he cold-cocks her, not long after, she finds herself in the middle of a wilderness buck naked. He, of course, is equipped with proper clothing attire, cross bow, and rifle. While, he has been successful as a predatory hunter(..he does have considerable advantages), this choice could be his undoing, for she's quite resourceful and strong.  From the director of Sole Survivor and Night of the Comet, Thom Eberhart tackles to survivalist adventure genre and Naked Fear adds a certain spin never to be topped. Kudos should be heaped on Danielle De Luca who goes far beyond the call of duty, her character naked and bruised in the middle of New Mexico wilderness..certainly a breathtaking setting to have this naked girl running about.   Not only does she deserve credit for baring everything for a large portion of the middle of the movie, but for her credible performance as a frightened victim who pushes herself to continue moving, despite her difficult circumstances. The role is incredibly demanding, and De Luca wasn't just some actress hired for how she looked in the buff. While spending a great deal of time, once her character awakens to find herself a quarry for the psychopath, running and hiding, trying to catch her breath at times, De Luca maintains our sympathy for her character's plight started from the very beginning and is established as a common occurrence in New Mexico..young, pretty girls snatched away from what they've known as a civilized world, flung into stripping and prostitution thanks to a series of events, call it fate if you wish, that landed them there.   JD Garfield is Colin Mandel, the psychotic predator who is so hellbent on catching and killing Diana(De Luca), he even assassinates a father and his two boys whose presence he wouldn't allow to thwart his mission. Arron Shiver is Dwight Terry, a newly hired deputy, fleeing from a past that haunts him, who suspects Colin when he discovers that Diana is the latest girl missing, and evidence builds against him. Joe Mantegna adds some respectability to the movie as a cop, Tom Benike, who attempts to warn Dwight against going down the road of investigating his friend(..Tom and Colin are hunting buddies).   Colin houses his victims' keepsakes in a tacklebox and we get a chance to witness his despicable antics as he pursues Diana, often bragging and grinning about his handiwork. He's such a loathsome scumbag, it doesn't take much to root for Diana to get the upper hand.   The plot might ask a leap of faith from the viewer concerning the idea that Diana could actually overcome her dire / grim situation, gaining an eventual advantage, using cunning and whatever weapons she could get her hands on in order to fight back against her stalker, but that's all part of the fun. If you can make it through the opening act, which sets up the characters involved in the movie, it'll be worth the wait...I felt that the movie could've been trimmed a bit and still would've been effective. Admittedly, sometimes you become side-tracked ogling De Luca's body(..or, at least, I did) despite her harrowing ordeal, the action sequences and exhilarating location are assets that accompany the eye candy."
2,"This is real children's stuff! The normal person (if one exists) isn't really going to know what the hell Pokémon is. You've got all these cute looking monsters with special powers and abilities and for some reason they're fighting each other. You see chances are that the normal person isn't really going to care. The film is based on the ever so popular TV series and that TV series is based on the ever so popular video game! And that usually means 'adults beware'!   The film is about Pokémon (of course), which translates as 'Pocket Monsters'. The main character is a Pokémon trainer by the name of Ash. He and his friends Brock, Misty and his loveably cute Pikachu accept a challenge to face off a rare evil Pokémon by the name of Mewtwo. Mewtwo is an experimental Pokémon that was genetically created by scientists. But just like Frankenstein, the experiment went berserk. So you see it's up to Ash and his friends to stop him. Now if none of this makes any sense to you then you might as well stop reading and forget about the film. It'll be probably be as complicated than an Alfred Hitchcock film!   Now to be honest, I actually quite like the TV series. It's enjoyable and funny. But the film is a very poor effort. There is a nice link between the TV series and the film that sheds some light on a few things, but it's only worth watching for that reason. Oh, and for the 'blink and you'll miss it scene' when a Tentacruel hugs Team Rocket! Also the animation isn't really anything ground breaking. There are a few noticeable touches but it isn't really that different from the TV show.   One great thing though was the villain Mewtwo! Now he was a proper bad guy. But this being a children's cartoon means you've got one of those violence is wrong messages and unfortunately there's also one of those dreamy endings. It's all highly predictable, simple and to put it straight, not very good.   Before the film there is the horrifically cute short titled 'Pikachu's Vacation'. It shows all of Ash's Pokémon basically having fun and are talking in their own way (as most Pokémon can only say their name). Subtitles might have been a benefit for the parents that were dragged to watch this. Why this precedes the film is quite a mystery, though I can only suggest that it's because the film itself is too short.   It may be awful but it's going to do very well and make a stack load of money mainly due to the incredible hype and a clever marketing campaign about collecting rare trading cards. In fact because of the success of this film, two sequels are on the way.   Kids are going to love it! Parents aren't going to understand it! The wise one is going to stay away from it!  My Rating - 4 out of 10"
0,"This movie was horrible, simply put. It was so bad I registered with IMDb to warn you of its dangers.  I am a campy horror film expert, per se. I have watched ""Redneck Zombies"", ""House of the Psychotic Women"", ""Slumber Party Massacre II"" and many others. I know my schlock. And I know this movie sucks.  Three fourths of the film is comprised of scared individuals running from one side of the screen to the other. When they are not running, they are spouting non-sequitur lines, devoid of emotion or motivation. When the actors begin to be acceptable, the direction falls to pieces. There were so many jarring low-angle shots; I figured Leif Jonker had a 3 foot tall tripod. He used what I call the ""Leif Maneuver"" several millions times: that is, zooming out from an object of interest like an amateur. Apparently the film crew couldn't get up early enough to film a sunrise, so they filmed a sunset... and played it in reverse. With direction this lazy, you are actually impressed with the final gory scene. The only thing you can figure is that the last five minutes was filmed before the first eighty-five minutes.  If you want a good (bad) gory movie, rent ""Riki-Oh"" or the foundational ""Dead Alive."" If you are a schlock buff, and are looking for a challenge, give ""Darkness"" a go.  Quote o' the movie-  Vampire: It's die time!"
0,"As soon as it hits a screen, it destroys all intelligent life forms around ! But on behalf of its producers I must say it doesn't fall into any known movie category, it deserves a brand new denomination of its own ! It's a ""Neurological drama"" ! It saddens and depresses every single neuron inside a person's brain.  It's the closest thing one will ever get to a stroke without actually suffering one. It drives you speechless, all you members go numb, your mouth falls open and remains so, and the most strange symptom of all is that you get yourself wishing to go blind and deaf.  No small feat for such a sort of a ""movie"".  The only word that comes to my mind just having finished my ordeal is OUTRAGE !!!!!!"
2,"I couldn't stand but 30 minutes of this swill. Lame, utterly stupid jokes used in the most idiotic instances: third grade dialogue with a kindergarten story. Who wrote this crap? Even Sandra looked like hell, positively fat. Putrid!"
2,"What a piece of crap, very disappointing should never have been made. Where are the original actors there's no jeff Daniels, no Danny DE Vito, the character of patsy was slim and pretty and smart and sophisticated in the first film but now shes replaced by some heavier actress who just acts dumb all the way through. Terms of endearment was one of the best films i ever saw but this one makes it look really bad. Too long and drawn out and what a shame that all the children turned out bad and that there father isn't in the picture. In the first he seemed to be there a lot but, how can he just never see them again after his wife dies how does that happen."
0,We've all seen this story a hundred times. You can see each plot turn coming a mile away. The relationship between the mother and daughter is way too sweet and understanding to pass for realistic. Janet Mcteer's performance is stock southern hot- ticket mother in vintage clothes. Should have been made for the Lifetime Channel.
1,"Soylent Green is a classic. I have been waiting for someone to re-do it.They seem to be remaking sci-fi classics these days (i.e. War of the Worlds)and I am hoping some director/producer will re-do Soylent Green. With todays computer animation and technology, it would have the potential to be a great picture. Anti-Utopian films may not be that far-fetched. The human race breeds like roaches with no outside influence to curtail it. We, as humans, have the option of putting the kibosh on the procreation of lesser species if they get out of hand, but there's nothing to control human breeding except for ourselves. Despite all the diseases, wars, abortions, birth control, etc. the human race still multiplies like bacteria in a petri dish. Classic Malthusian economics states that any species, including humans, will multiply beyond their means of subsistence. 6 billion and growing....that's obscene."
0,"As far as HEIST movies go, this one is pretty weak. Continuity is pretty lousy, there isn't enough character continuity to really feel like you understand any of the characters. Peter Falk is great, and he is one of the reasons its worth watching. Falk has some great lines, like ""he'll be right back, he goin' buy to some saugages"" or something like that... there are a few nice scenes, although they are entirely due to the efforts of the actors. Direction, script, and editing is pretty lousy."
0,"This is a low budget Roger Corman horror/creature flick. A DinoCroc is created when manipulation of prehistoric genes runs amok. An engineered croc first kills one of its own then gets the taste of human and becomes a fast growing terror after escaping. None of the characters have any depth, but then they are not the focal point. We only get a few glimpses of the huge two-legged dinosaur descendant and some of the best ""kill"" scenes in a small budget film.  My favorite scene is of a moronic character trying to use a three legged dog for bait and becomes croc food himself. Nothing left on the pier but ankle top feet. With no real stand out roles: Jane Longendecker, Bruce Weitz and Charles Napier. Most pathetic is Matt Borlenghi and an obnoxious professional croc hunter Costas Mandylor. I was most impressed with the alluring Joanna Pacula as the respectfully feared Dr. P. DINOCROC is redeeming as a crock of pickles."
2,"I love watching horrible movies in general. From Shaq to Manos to ninja movies, I almost always cry from laughter.  Not this time.  This movie was not even close to funny bad, it was just painful. It was boring, except for the few fighting scenes, and the plot (whatever there was of it) made NO sense. The climax is utterly inexplicable, and I wouldn't mind if someone could explain exactly what it was all about.  The scenes showing ridiculous ninja powers (eg, flight and toxic barf) are hilarious, but far too few to save this movie. I'll never watch it again."
2,"Cindy is a very curious girl. Her big sister Donna can get all the men she desires, in fact she has a new one every night of the week. Even her good ol' dad is having an affair with a stripper he met at a bar. (Looking at his screechy shrew of a wife, I'm not surprised..) Why can't she get that kind of passion in her life? So follows two hours of tedious 'coming of age' drama which basically is film-speak for ""lets convince our young starlets to deprive themselves of their tops every two minutes"".I have to admit I was shocked not to discover Russ Meyer's name among the credits. Mind you, the women in this movie are probably not quite busty enough for him, and there's no sign of the underlying humour here that you see in his best work. Yep, this is serious stuff all the way, and all the softcore sex, lesbian, massage and shower scenes seem to be building up towards making a firm point about the futility of a hedonistic lifestyle. Personally I'm not buying it for a minute.. this is a skin flick with a moralistic ending thrown in an afterthought just to satisfy the censors so it could get a mainstream release. In the matter of whether you should watch it or not, I would say: If you want mild porn, go to one of the many specialist shops that cater to your particular needs. If you want a quality movie about growing up, I would suggest The Breakfast Club or Flirting. Under no accounts should you sit through this nonsense. Unless you want to be put off sex for life.. 0/10"
0,"Rosario Dawson stars as a girl who is date raped and then begins a decent into darkness until given a chance at revenge. While its clear why Dawson took the role, its a chance to show her acting chops and to make a small independent, decidedly un-Hollywood film, its also clear that aside from stunning good looks, Dawson seems out of place in the role. Forgive me I simply couldn't find her. Thats not a mistake, thats how I felt, I had no idea where she was. Yes I know she's on the screen but even though I spent the better part of two hours looking at her she left no impression on me whats so ever. I blame the script for this since other than the ending, not a whole heck of a lot that happened on screen seemed to make any real sense. The people seemed to be more posture than real and what happens didn't seem to fit together. Forgive me for being vague but nothing in this film, other than the end (which I would love to talk about but can't cause it would spoil it), and the image of Rosario Dawson as nothing more than an image, stayed with me.What can I say, this may click with you, it may not, for me it's time I can't get back. For Rosario Dawson fans only, though be warned there's several real reasons why this is NC17. (And Rosario- please, you're a better actress, pick better scripts)"
2,"This combination black comedy/sexploitation/thriller from director Roger Vadim is undoubtedly the most provocative American movie to come out of the 70's. It starts off with Ponce, our male protagonist, watching as girls pass by. We are given a shot that clues us into the tone of the entire film. Vadim films two teenage girls walking from behind and then brazenly zooms in on their behinds. I was a bit shocked to see Vadim open his movie with such a blatant butt shot. That was until I recalled that this same director opened up his 1956 film, And God Created Woman, with a closeup shot of Brigitte Bardot's bare behind. It's undeniably sexy, but some will see it as sexualizing children as these two girls in their mini-skirts look awfully young. But I credit the director for nailing what it feels be like to be a male high school student surrounded by beautiful female peers through the use of brilliant POV.  We then shift to an outside shot of a high school. We're given a few scenes of the students going about their daily activities. All the female students are impossibly beautiful here, dressed in mini-skirts, high heels, and low cut shirts. We are then introduced to Tiger, played by Rock Hudson, in one of his most offbeat roles. He plays a coach/counselor at a Southern Californian High School. Even though he is a married man, he has no qualms having sex with various female students. Meanwhile, a killer is leaving corpses of female students along various parts of the school. An investigation begins and Tiger is the prime suspect. In the meantime, one of his students, Ponce is having a tough time finding a girlfriend. Tiger is willing to give the young man some help. He enlists the help of Miss Smith, played by Angie Dickinson, to help Ponce along, and we are talking about a VERY adult education.   Pretty Maids was a mega flop on first release, and it permanently damaged Vadim's career. But today it has the earmarks of a classic, mostly due to three brilliant performances. First off, Rock Hudson in perhaps his last great picture. Just like he was in every other picture before Pretty Maids, he's the man girls want and the man boys want to be, but here it's darker and more cynical version of himself than he ever let people see on the screen. John David Carson is fascinating as Ponce. He goes from awkward school boy to confident man in a series of believable, sequences. It's a difficult role to play, but he makes it look easy. Angie Dickinson has never been better. Angie is sexy throughout the movie playing a naive young teacher, seemingly unaware of how sexy she is.  The premise of this Pretty Maids is ""free love"" for all, which includes teachers having sex with their students! It's shocking to look back and see how strange America was during this time of ""free love,"" as the concept of this movie would be completely taboo now. American is far more puritanical today, especially when it comes to the issue of teens and sex. I think the reason it still hasn't found a home on DVD is because the film takes a libertine view of adolescent sexuality, far more than any other American film has. America has a hard time with this and this film could turn a lot more heads now than perhaps it did in the more permissive 70's. The basic plot premise is shocking, but what REALLY grabs your attention are the literally hundreds of leering shots of female butts, breasts, crotches, legs, or a combo of the 4, all belonging to the various female high school appearing in this film. Just about every female actress playing the part of a student is sexualized in this movie. Outside of a Tinto Brass movie, I can't recall any other film that lovingly showcased the female posterior by filming it in closeup again and again. As outrageous as the numerous shots of rear ends are, they can't hold a candle to all the up skirt peeks director Vadim shows us. We are given scene after scene of girls in impossibly sort mini-skirts bending over, crossing their legs, standing on elevated surfaces, or just walking up the steps. Vadim finds it mandatory to show us a flash of their panties every time. Pretty Maids must have set some sort of record for pantie shots than any movie in history. Did girls in the early 70's really dress like THIS? I can't help but wonder where were there parents during the making of the film? As a man who would like to have a child someday, and hopefully a little girl, it's odd seeing Vadim's camera practically rams itself up the mini-skirt of a young girl going through puberty. If you're a father of a teenage girl and you're reading this review, you might feel guilty for enjoying the content of this movie. But you really shouldn't be. However, I can't emphasize this enough: The girls who appear in this film are NOT the type portrayed in movies that deal with H.S. You know, 20 something actresses cast as H.S. students. The actresses playing the young girls in this movie are actually that, young girls. Some will find the nonstop leering shots of girls who appear to be in the 15-19 age range to cross the line of good taste. I found them VERY necessary considering they were meant to show how Ponce (not to mention director Vadim) views high school aged girls.  I suppose a film that deals this frankly with adolescent sexuality this could be made today, but only as an unreleased independent film, ala Ken Park. In the 70s, however, this script was able to attract a whole plethora of respected actors and actresses. You'll ask yourself the whole time how a movie like this could be made in the first place! See it now."
2,"While I hesitate to be a party-pooper, I must call a spade a spade and say that (IMHO) this film would probably NOT have gained general release had it not been for the tragic circumstances of the writer/director's demise.  The acting is fine, 'tho a bit amateurish, the editing is crisp, and the cinematography is acceptable. The major faults lie in the story and direction. There's hardly any substance here. It's doesn't work as comedy - not even light-grey (certainly not ""dark"") comedy... characters are poorly developed (except for what other chrs have to say about them -- sure, Earl is a jerk, but not all that bad a jerk, and - for that matter, so is the sexually exploitative and wholly unethical Dr. P, and Becky and Dawn tell us that Joe is insufferable and Cal a mean-spirited slave-driver). The only chr I could see with any clarity was Ogie (sp?), and that's because there wasn't much there to begin with. No one's motives were any more than hearsay by other chrs.  Was this a morality tale? A comedy? A spoof? (Of what?) A love story? (certainly not! How could one see the frantic necking and sex between Dr. P and Jenna as being in any way serious?) It could be called a ""chick flick,"" but only if the definition of chick-flick insists that every male chr be a self-interested, sex-seeking arschloch. Were the chrs stereotypes? Clichés? WHAT WAS THE POINT?  To be sure, this was an earnest effort at film-making/storytelling, but it falls far short of just about everything except ""cute."""
1,"Well let me go say this because i love history and I know that movie is most important piece in our history and it was beautifully executed movie and Julia Stiles became my #1 favorite actress after seeing her in ""The '60s"" and i own this movie in my video box with many movies and i suggest you to look for her new movies in the future and try to enjoy history!!!!"
0,"I was searching through Hollywood video last night with a friend trying to find a good-looking horror movie to watch over the New Year's weekend. As I was looking through the shelves, ""Severed"" spotted my eye, and I grabbed it off the shelf and it looked like it might be a decent B-grade horror movie. The cover looked fairly good. The plot sounded semi-interesting. So I rented it. What a mistake. Don't be fooled by the cover, which actually looks decent. I'm thinking that more money was spent on the cover artwork than the movie itself. The film follows two police detectives who are tracking down a voodoo-inspired, ritualistic serial killer called ""The Head Hunter"", who is decapitating victims left and right in some unnamed city (probably Los Angeles), and they become drawn into his world of ritualized murder.  Story sound somewhat good? Well, it is, and this movie could've been halfway decent. But good God, it was bad! Almost everything about it was laughable. The opening scene features some redheaded actress in a car trying to talk on this huge, outdated cell phone, and for whatever reason, she goes outside and talks to some guy. Then, a shadow comes up behind them, hacks off his head, and the girl drops to the ground and starts crawling (for absolutely no reason) while trying to dial 911. Sound ridiculous? Yep, you bet it is. The entire movie looks like it was filmed on a VHS-quality camera, and I'm assuming it was. The acting was mostly awful, and the special effects were far from believable. And the scenes with the policemen on the phone were awful - the voice on the other line was echoing and it sounded like it was being recorded in someone's bathroom. Everything about this movie was simply amateurish and tedious, and it didn't hold my interest for very long, and I often found myself bored and tired, mostly because of the bad acting and the horrible cinematography. The pacing was bad. Everything was just bad.  Overall, ""Severed"" is a failed attempt at what could have been a decent B-movie. The plot was good and I think if this film had been handled better and had a higher budget, it could've been alright. But this movie fell flat on it's face. If you're expecting something semi-decent, you'll be sorely disappointed. Only recommended if you can tolerate D-grade horror flicks. Otherwise, you'll probably want to stay away from this straight-to-video garbage. It had a little potential, but it was beyond a mess. 1/10."
0,"This was just horrible the plot was just OK, but the rest of the was was bad . I mean come on puppet and then they even tried to make the movie digital and that made it even worse! Normally I would like low-budget movie but this was just a waste of time and almost made me want to return the set that it came on. I have about ten low-budget movie set with like 6-8 movies on them and I would have to say this is the worse movie out of all of them. Also the wording is off and they use a fake plastic machetes that doesn't even look like a real one, they could of used one that looked even a little close to a real one so save your time and money and don't watch this horrorible movie."
2,"I'd heard about this movie because a friend of mine let me know that Adam Brody was in it. She's really into The OC and wanted me to watch it with her. I was curious to see what Adam could do outside of the TV show and was completely pleasantly surprised. Adam Brody's acting was excellent.  The movie can appeal to both the young and old alike given the diverse cast. I was immediately drawn to it more because of hearing that Illeana Douglass was in it. I'm a fan of her!   The film can also be especially appealing at this time since it deals with losing someone in the war. It was such a touching movie, it made me cry and I totally recommend it to anyone!"
2,"I truly feel bad for the cast/crew that was involved in making this picture. What could have been a wonderfully told legitimate story of Jesus's life turned out to be just a story of a black man. Due to poor writing/directing, the main focus of the movie was that the Romans were after a black Jew. The story of Jesus is just an afterthought. With things like Mary being turned away from the Inn because she was black, and lines by the centurion ""you're not black enough"" its not hard not to see how poorly this was put together. The acting wasn't too bad, but many of the accents were poor. It sounded like some of them were French and Scottish, lol. The outdoor sets looked like leftovers from a Xena shoot, but were believable. Some of the indoor sets looked like someone's house with sheets draped on the walls. Not professional at all. I can't recommend this to anyone.  Oh, and whats with the ""black Jew"" having what looked like an acid trip while praying in the garden. His eyes went all wild, he saw 3 moons in the sky, and started thrashing around throwing grass on himself. Bizarre."
2,"I never even heard of this movie, until about a year ago. I seen it for sale at blockbuster. I bought it because of Sean Penn. This is one good gangster movie that few know about. The acting is great, it surprises you and even has a pretty good love story going on. One of the best scenes you have to see, is when Ed Harris meets with his boss about killing his brother(Oldman). The tension is so strong when he tells his gang to come and back him up if he don't call by 2:oo o'clock. This is good movie making. You have to see this scene and the movie has a lot of great ones. I highly recommend State of Grace."
0,"Is it just me or is that kid really annoying?  Hideos sister, spends most of her time running around after the disobedient little so and so. As for him, well, I know he's a kid n all, but his acting ability is about as wooden as a dead tree. So far I'm only half way through, and am fascinated by the story, but the people in it, let it down, I just hope it gets better by the end, as I can't not know what it's all about. Although, some supposedly cryptic messages in the scribbles on the wall and a notebook, indicate everything is backwards, i.e. Dog is God, Live is Evil etc... just seems a little obvious at the moment, yet nobody mentions its obvious meaning, (As yet anyway) If my opinion changes at the end of the movie, I'll update this post, but if your reading this, then well...... See above statement."
1,"This movie had an interesting cast, it mat not have had an a list cast but the actors that were in this film did a good job. Im glad we have b grade movies like this one, the story is basic the actors are basic and so is the way they execute it, you don't need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot. I like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what i though was interesting is that they didn't close down a café to set there gear and that they did it all from a police station. Arnold vosloo and Michael madsen did a great job at portraying there roles in the hostage situation. This was a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near future."
0,This is quite possibly the worst movie of all time. It stars Shaquille O'Neil and is about a rapping genie. Apparently someone out there thought that this was a good idea and got suckered into dishing out cash to produce this wonderful masterpiece. The movie gets 1 out of 10.
2,"This is definitely the best version of ""A Little Princess"" that I've ever personally seen. Unlike that crappy 1995 one set in New York or the one with Shirley Temple making me want to slap her, the PBS version had a Sara who looked like Sara as she was described in the book. Not only that, she *acted* like the Sara in the book, not like a whiny, boring little snot. All the acting was very good, especially Miss Minchin's sister (Miriam Margolyes) and the other schoolgirls. The screenplay was excellent. Without relying on copying the actual words and phrases of the book (although crucial plot moments were often almost word-for-word), it was very true to the spirit and intention of the book and didn't offend people who have loved and re-read the story. This is unusual for a movie based on a book. Also, the cinematography showed the dreariness of Sara's life and world very clearly with its rainy, muted colors.  All in all this was a completely wonderful movie. See it if you possibly can, although since it was broadcast on PBS at least ten years ago it's probably hard to find ."
2,"I normally like movie musicals but not this one.  At the time, young director Francis Ford Coppola was in way over his head and clearly out of his element. He did not know how to shape dialog or stage the songs - he seems unbelievably clueless. The movie crawls along at a snail's pace. It absolutely amazes me that the studio didn't pull him off the project after the first few weeks.   There's hardly anything to recommend this film.  Fred Astaire and Petula Clark's talents were really wasted here and it's almost painful to watch.  Amazingly, the director and cameraman did not even pull the cameras back far enough to see Astaire's feet when he was dancing! The feet or legs are actually at the edge of the frame or sometimes out of frame altogether.   Some good music, lousy story, BAD direction and a movie worth missing.  If you are interested in good movie musicals of the same era, try Music Man 1962, Sound of Music 1965, Funny Girl 1968, Hello Dolly 1969, Godspell 1973."
2,"The sensitive issue of rape has, over the years, become very formulaic in films. The conflicts of which typically entail a woman bringing her assailant to justice via proving that she was raped despite ample disbelief and even ridicule. Writer/director Douglas Tirola's ""A Reason to Believe"" is certainly no exception under those circumstances, but stereotypical (and even ostentatious) characterizations of men and women and other situations make this film very unbelievable.  Like many film's that take place in college settings, the characters in Reason who are members of fraternities and sororities are both promiscuous and fond of alcohol and drugs. These pleasures are essentials throughout the Viking party hosted by the Beta fraternity house, at which attendees are scantily clad in togas and drink, get high, and get laid. It is at this party that Charlotte (Allison Smith) is raped by frat boy and friend Jim (Jay Underwood). Since Charlotte's attire wasn't conservative and she was seen dancing with Jim and because she didn't physically struggle with Jim when he raped her, it is not surprising that no one believes her when she claims that his advances were unwanted especially since, by this point, Jim has already bragged to his entire fraternity about his encounter with Charlotte. Among Jim's fraternity brothers is Charlotte's boyfriend Wesley (Danny Quinn), who was not only absent from the party but who also told Charlotte that he didn't want her to attend it for fear that she would look like ""fraternity groupie"", and the token stoner Potto (Keith Coogan) who actually witnessed the rape but remains mostly quiet about it. After all, who is going to buy his story since he was on drugs at the time? Despite Wesley's jealousy, it is ridiculous that he would be much quicker to believe Jim over Charlotte, but then again, the first time Wesley expresses his love for Charlotte is during a period of sex.  Further stereotypes are noted in Linda (Georgia Emelin) and her campus women's group, which, in many ways, desensitize the issue of rape. As a hardcore feminist, Linda pulls out all the stops for the benefit of her group and most of the women on campus such as demanding that the dean publish a rape victim's police report, voicing her hatred for all fraternities, and even referring to Jim's girlfriend Judith (Kim Walker) as a prostitute during the Viking party. The presence of Linda and her fellow feminists is ironic for after Charlotte is raped, she doesn't contact anyone who either anonymous or bound to confidentiality such as a therapist or law enforcer. Instead, she contacts the campus crisis center and speaks to one of Linda's cohorts who ultimately relays the entire story to Linda who arrogantly uses the incident bring her own women-related issues to the forefront.  The film's greatest flaw is the action that Charlotte decides to take. In an effort to avoid publicity (as if being seen with Linda could that) and time spent in a court of law, Charlotte takes her case to the school's administration board who, despite having no real evidence or feedback from a lawyer (and perhaps to shut Linda up), conclude that Jim actually raped Charlotte. As punishment, Jim is not arrested, but just expelled. I will not deny that this was similar to the ending I would like to have see, but it confines the film too much to a college atmosphere and the absence of people who are neither students nor faculty members doesn't make for a believable story about rape.  I give this film four stars for the actors in it clearly made the most of the material they had to work with and as far as production goes, the crew succeeded in making the most of their low budget. As a first-time writer/director, Tirola's intentions are both sentimental and noble. Unfortunately, the only the believable aspect of this film about rape is the rape itself."
0,"Just watched this after hearing about how bad it was and wanted to see for myself. Seriously, even if you read all the negative comments on here you will be nowhere near able to comprehend how awful this film actually is, although it has to be one of the most hilarious things I have ever seen! Never bothered to post a comment on here before, but this piece of crap really warrants it.   Firstly the entire plot is ridiculous and nonsensical. Brother of the lead character (either Ben or Arthur, I forget which is which, and frankly it's never very clear) wants to stop some kind of gay marriage by killing everyone in sight - because homosexuality is abhorrent to Christians, but apparently mass murder isn't. Then there's some other crap thrown in about one of the gay couple's ex-wife trying to force him to remarry her at gunpoint. This leads to nothing, but provides us with one of the funniest lines of dialogue in the whole ""film"" - ""I don't make sense? You don't make sense! That's who makes sense!"". Brilliant.  Then there's the acting, which is just atrocious. It must be seen to be believed. My personal favourite is the apparently stoned civil rights lawyer woman, who is clearly reading her lines off of something, yet still managing to mess them up. Enough said. The gay couple couldn't be less convincing. There's the vaguely attractive and completely gormless guy, and his boyfriend who looks like that little cartoon dough man of the bisto adverts. Only fatter. And less talented.   The ""film"" has also been filmed by someone who is incapable of holding a camera even remotely still, and the number of mistakes throughout is amazing. The whole thing kicks off with the fat main guy in bed with a pair of boots on. Yep.  But anyways, we all know how terrible this thing is, so I'd like to highlight some of the most priceless comedy moments that the ""film"" provides.   - When the fat guy sets the church on fire and then prances like a six year old girl across the car park to make his escape. Hilarious.  - Mildread! No idea what relation she is to the main characters - sometimes they know her, sometimes they don't, but she pops up in a couple of scenes nonetheless. Hilarious.  - The stoned lawyer. Already mentioned her, but she's so funny she's worth another mention.  - The evil brothers dinner of crackers that he lays on for his guests.  - The evil brother's anti-gay potion.  - The evil brother's cats.  - The ending, which I won't give away because it MUST be seen to be believed. I warn you though, make sure you're not eating at the time!!!! The tub of lard main character/director/producer gets naked. It's foul.   Basically, Ben and Arthur is indescribably bad, but unintentionally the most comical thing you'll see for a long time. Literally, nothing is good about this excuse for a film, the goon of a director even manages to make the opening credits into a joke by writing his own name about 15 times."
2,"I was saddened that this movie had such a low rating. I've watched it many, many times over the years, and it continues to entertain. It is, perhaps, the last good ""hacker"" film (well, 23 (1998) also comes to mind, but that isn't widely available in English).  The math is believable (Janek's lecture makes sense), as is the technology (except for the Hollywood-ish decryption displays -- but that's forgivable). The characters are among the most realistic in any of these movies (with the exception of Joey the lamer in Hackers (1995) -- most accurate character in a hacking movie I've seen yet). They're each composites of well-known people from the 80s security scene. The techniques they use are the techniques of the business, especially in that era.  Now that computers have become such a big thing, I don't think it would be possible for Hollywood to produce another movie like this. Anything made now would have to be far more glamorous and unrealistic.  What's this movie got, if you don't care about any of that stuff? It's tremendously funny, cleverly written (every scene works overtime to say and do more than one thing), and beautifully shot and scored. (The opening scene and transition is wonderful) The acting is priceless. I've never met someone who didn't love this film. See it."
2,"With people like Rodney Dangerfield as ""the Rodfather"" and Dom DeLuise as ""The Oddfather"" I had hopes for this one...dashed immediately the actors started flapping their gums. Who wrote this script? It stinks! And the director couldn't direct traffic. Some good set-ups that fall apart, horrible gags -- it's a spoof that doesn't work at all. Why was this movie made? Compared to this, ""Mafia"" is actually a fine film (and I hated it when it came out!) I would suspect that the sole ""positive comments"" from two reviewers were probably the director's wife and his best friend as no one I've met who has seen this film enjoyed it at all."
2,"In its genre: fantasy and sci-fi this is a guaranteed winner. Yes, it IS Alien vs. Highlander... and if you don't think that sounds awesome, well then you're missing out.  What lifts this though is a great cast, tight filming, good production, and above all that some heart and soul that's been missing.  Honestly this is straight-out entertainment - the Alien is seriously bad, and the Nordic stuff is just how you'd want it to be. Just violent enough, with some horror, but nothing OTT it is very, very good at achieving its objectives.  All in all a great film and a definite Sci-Fi / Fantasy con favorite in the making..."
2,"Wow, I saw this movie last night and it was amazing! I have always had a love for horses and have been around them for over seven years, but that's not the only reason why I loved ""Dreamer"" as much as I did.  All the actors and actresses did such a great job in this movie. I have been a fan of Dakota Fanning for a while now, and I think she does well in almost everything she does, but I don't think it would be possible for her to do any better than she did in this movie. She played her character Cale Crane, perfectly. It was obvious throughout the movie that she loved her horse, Sonador, with all of her heart. She would even sneak out at night to feed her Popsicles! In real life, Dakota has her own horse named Goldie, so she was already used to being around horses before she started filming this movie.  Kurt Russel also did an amazing job in this movie. Honestly, I don't think there is any other actor out there that deserved that part more than he did. I've seen Elisabeth Shue (Lily Crane) in another one of her most recent movies, ""Hide and Seek,"" which is a completely different genre of movie, but I thought she did a great job in it, and ""Dreamer"" as well. Dakota Fanning was also in ""Hide and Seek,"" and did a great job too, as usual.  I didn't even notice one single thing in this movie that I would have changed. It was just so good, and I think there should be more movies like this to be made in the future. Everyone in the theater clapped and cheered when Cale's horse Sonador, crossed the finish line in first place at the Breeder's Cup. ""Dreamer"" is a movie that anyone can enjoy, so if you are looking for a really, really good, inspirational movie, I highly suggest you go see this one. 10/10."
0,"I got this movie because I worked at a movie store so I got free rentals. It came in, and the cover made it look alright. Hot chick, carrying a weapon, alright, I'll check it out.  Oh man, bad move. This was so horrible, I spent half the movie watching in fast-forward to get to the nudity, which was minimal. I think MAYBE three scenes of partial nudity.  Cheesy dialogue, crappy violence, poor excuses of characters. I feel bad putting this movie down, because I know it was made on a cheap budget, but so was ""Clerks"" and it became a cult classic and a franchise.  2/10."
0,"Incredible. Does it get any dumber than this? Not a chance. The stupidity in this movie would shame even Ed Wood, De Palma, and Woo. If the first part in the series had mediocre dialog and the second one had bad dialog, then this one has cretinous dialog. Amazing. But this time the story has been lowered to the level of the dialog, too. In spite of the acting and the dialog, I liked the first two films, but ""Cube Zero"" will surely kill the franchise. The utterly moronic plot so obviously stems from the pen of a frustrated left-winger.  I sometimes wonder if such leftists even themselves realize just how anti-democracy and pro-dictatorship they are. In this movie they obviously target the US  a democracy. Why don't they target Korea, Iran, Syria, China, Zimbabwe etc. in anti-military movies? Sure, most of these places are hardly likely to produce a cube like this any time soon, but that's beside the point. It's obvious: writers of garbage like this actually admire these kinds of regimes, whether they are aware of it or not. I would even go as far as to say that ANYONE who adamantly attacks US foreign policies all the time, has anti-democratic beliefs in his core.  Back to the movie: apart from being so far-fetched that it isn't even funny any more, the film has many obvious illogicalities. For example, for some reason the two men who supervise the cube have done it for a while and are oblivious to the pain and sadism that the project entails, yet the first one than the other suddenly turn against the system! Anyone who has any idea at all about human nature will see right through this idiocy. Or how about that cretinous character, the one-eyed evil bureaucrat who talks as if he's in a bad Mel Brooks comedy. In fact, as soon as this creature appears the movie loses ALL seriousness and hence any chance of being exciting: it really does become a comedy."
2,"I didn't watch the BM show till just recently now that it's in reruns and I LOVE it. Soooooooooo cute. Very well done. Much better than The Cosby Show, more real for sure. I love the boy's devilish laugh and I love the way the little girl (baby girl) says: "" Uncle Bernie""??? So sweet and innocent. The oldest child's problems as a teenager are done very well too. So glad I found out about this show. Won't miss an episode. Does anyone know where I can write BM to tell him how much I love his show? I also get a kick out of how protective he is of the kids. That's true love. And they always seem to try to out smart Bernie but not without a fight from Bernie.   Bravo Bernie on a great show. Too bad it's gone but at least we have it in reruns."
2,"*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* Interesting, entertaining crime drama set in the wild days of China's very own ""sin city."" Hence there's plenty of raucous nightclubs, chorus lines, Chinese gangsters, packed dancefloors and assorted inequities for every taste.   With this backdrop, a young, orphaned moppet from the countryside arrives, and is put to work by his distant family.  The story, directed by Zhang Yimou, is woven skillfully to encompass the many sides of its characters. A veritable tapestry of rich characterizations come forth. Of course, the darker side of organized crime, away from the spectacular show numbers and bounding bonvivant feeling, we are shown in gritty detail. For example, the seedy, suffocating quality of life that has become, in essence, living death for a gangster's moll. The country boy, in a strange way becomes her sounding board. The two finds themselves so desperately out of control of their lives, they exude anguish.  In summation, the film is visually sumptuous, the performances are rather good (although a notable few are wooden) and the story line is clever. Recommended."
2,Blowing your brains out is the answer and that's just what Daffy Duck ends up doing.  The cartoon opens in the office of one of the Warner Brothers producers. Daffy is trying to get him interested in making a movie from his 1000 page script 'The Scarlet Pumpernickel'. Daffy plays a swashbuckling hero/thief who would like for no more than to marry his maiden in peril. But Sylvester is out to catch him and take her for himself.  The producer likes Daffy's script but need a bigger ending. How about a tidal wave? Not good enough? And a volcano explodes? Not good enough. But there's nothing left for the Scarlett Pumpernickel to do but blow his brains out?  Blam!  I love that Duck.
2,"Sleepless is the most recent work I've seen from horror master Dario Argento (Deep Red, Suspiria). I'm ashamed to mention I haven't even seen his contributions to the Masters of Horror series but I heard it's good, especially Jennifer. Before watching Sleepless, I was told Argento was back in great shape. Still I had rather low expectations. And it seems I was right. Though its opening sequence is great and so is Max Von Sydow's character, most of the movie is nothing but a below average thriller. The death scenes are quite nasty, but there's no atmosphere. The soundtrack is good, but there's nothing creepy or dreamlike about the images. It's just pure B-movie looking without emotions, good or bad. Maybe I should get over my eternal nostalgia about 70s horror. Maybe I should get over the fact that an experience like Suspiria only happens once in a lifetime (unless you buy the DVD). Maybe I should just try to appreciate this movie for what it is. But I can't. A somehow interesting film, for fans of Italian thrillers or people who love Dario Argento, but don't expect a masterpiece."
2,"This is a first for the French cinema, the remake of an American film, when just the opposite is what happens always. The Americans love to redo what some French director did before, with mediocre results. ""The Beat that my Heart Skipped"" was adapted for the screen by Jacques Audiard and Tonino Benaquesta, from the 1978 film by James Toback, an under appreciated director that deserves more credit for his work in this country. Mr. Audiard directed the French version.  As a character study of Thomas, the film somewhat succeeds in presenting his ambivalence as a petty criminal and as a frustrated pianist that is trying to regain his skill in playing the instrument. Thomas is, from all accounts, an ugly character that will engage in all kinds of under handed situations in order to make a living. Most of the motivation in Thomas' actions is driven by his loyalty to his small crook father, who is constantly nagging him to take care of the old man's criminal activities as well.  In Romain Duris, director Audiard gets a multi layered performance that is what keeps the film going. Mr. Duris, an intense actor, is the dominant figure in the movie, and perhaps the excuse for seeing the film. Nils Arestrup, as the father, has also some good moments."
2,"I knew when I picked up the box that it would be a pretty bad movie. Still, I wanted to see Shannon Lee and the movie having Michael Dorn in it looked like it could be a sleeper. It wasn't...  Shannon Lee and Michael Dorn did a good job with what they were given. The rest of the movie was pretty bad. I won't repeat what has already been said by others. They put it pretty well.  I can see why the actors made the movie. It's easy for me to imagine reading the script and thinking that it had the potential to be better than it turned out to be. Too bad...  If you like Shannon Lee, you may not be too disappointed with this movie. I'm glad that I picked it up, but wouldn't watch it again."
2,"If anyone ever asks why Douglas Fairbanks was such a big star, tell them to view this film. His personality ""leaps"" off the screen and the film is as exciting as it was in 1924. True, some of the ""special effects"" are a little corny by today's standards, but the film holds up, nevertheless.  And to all those who appreciate the male form, Douglas Fairbanks physique is unbelievable!"
1,"Spoiler This is a great film about a conure. He goes through quite the ordeal trying to get back to his little girl owner. He learns a lot through his journey and meets up with a lot of other beautiful birds. If you love birds like my wife does, this film is for you. This film also has some sad parts that make the tears run. In the end it all works out for Paulie and his Russian friend. Rent this for the whole family, everyone will enjoy this."
2,"Evil Spawn (1987) was a cheaply produced film that reeks of poverty. You have a good premise but it's faulty execution has no real pay off. A couple of good scenes does not a movie make. Too bad, because the actresses were good looking (especially the brunette) and the idea was solid. Maybe they should have a better story writer and a little more imagination. I saw this movie a few years ago at a Mr. Video store (rest in peace). Back then the cheesy video cover screamed cheap-cheap. I should have listened to my head instead of my eyes. Oh well. Perhaps a film-maker with more on the ball would make a better production.  An aging actress will do anything to look young again (my advice is to stay out of the sun lady). So she comes across a crazy old scientist and his shady associate. He's working on an experimental formula that'll reduce the signs of aging (the good doctor should have used a little dab himself me thinks). But before he can work out all of the ""bugs"", tragedy occurs but that doesn't stop the old B-Queen from using it.  The story might sound interesting but please stay away unless YOU REALLY like bad movies. Because there is really no need for someone (or anyone) to watch this ""movie"". Maybe next time they should concentrate more on the adult aspect of the storyline.  Best to avoid.  If it wasn't for the hot brunette this one would get a zero or a negative rating."
2,"Terribly unappetizing stew from Bert I. Gordon, an adaptation of H.G. Wells' story concerning a band of campers fighting off rats and chickens enlarged to monstrous proportions. The dark, clammy 'woodsy' setting is visually ugly, not helped by the film's low budget and really rotten special effects. Yes, it's a Grade-Z horror movie, but for a film in which the effects are the drawing-card, this one fumbles the ball right out of the gate. Surely Gordon didn't spend all his money on the cast: Marjoe Gortner, Ralph Meeker, Pamela Franklin, and most especially Ida Lupino all look as if they'd rather be elsewhere. Shockingly, the picture did attract some business, creating a small cult which lead to a quasi-sequel in 1989. NO STARS from ****"
2,"Why in the world would anyone want to watch a remake of Dawn of the Dead, when you can watch the original? Not only is this a bad remake with Black and Latino gang members in Los Angeles locked in a warehouse to escape the zombies, it is racist to boot.  It has been a while since I have see Mantan Moreland yelling ""Feets don't fail me now,"" but I certainly expected it to come out of the mouth of Dayana Jamine, who played the sister of one of the Black gang members like Moreland.  Noel Gugliemi played Caesar, the leader of the Latin gang in a obnoxious stereotype of all ultra macho Hispanic. It was pure racism.  The zombie action was good when you saw it, but that was sparse as most of the action took place in the warehouse.  Janine Foster was the best character in the movie, and I look for more of her in the future.  Neat ending, though."
0,"Bobby is a goofy kid who smiles far too much and wants sex. So he buys a van to aid in this quest. The acting is lame, the comedy is pathetic and the script is no more than a loosely strung chain of clichés and cheap thrills. The makers of the film obviously wanted to capture some of the out there craziness of other films of the time, but fell a long way short. They even resort to Bobby slipping on a banana skin, because this will supposedly add comedic value.  I'm struggling to find a redeeming feature of the film. If you like DeVito, this is another classic DeVito kind of role - but he's only a supporting actor and there for cliché value."
2,The bomb is about to go off any day now outside and inside the home of Rose. She has a stepfather who loves her little sisters but doesn't really adore her that much. Jack has other problems as well such as drinking and flashbacks from war. One day he likes Rose and then the next minute he becomes a horrible monster. I see that this movie is like a bomb going off. The characters in the movie have no idea when this bomb is going to go off. They also have no idea when Jack is going to fly into a rage or have another flashback. It's a sad little movie but it has a lot of sense of reality attached to it. Then Aunt Starr comes in a gets involved in all of it. She adds some spice to the whole bomb. It's a great movie.
0,"""National Lampoon Goes to the Movies"" is the worst movie ever made, surpassing even the witless ""Plan 9 from Outer Space."" At least that movie was just inept; the Lampoon film, on the other hand, is both inept and mean. Once upon a time, movies used to respect their audiences' intelligence. This one, however, holds a fetid, rotting carcass up to our faces -- and then tries to rub our noses in it.  Another reviewer on this site wrote that the only good parts of the movie are the nude scenes; and I agree, Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry do flash a bit of flesh, and very nice flesh it is. But the directors seem not to realize that even T&A needs a good story to surround it. There's none of that here.  Perversely, the film makers save the worst for last. The third of the three segments is the ugliest of the trio. In this vignette, Robby Benson plays an eager-beaver young police officer reporting for duty on his first day on the job. He is paired with a weary, cynical oldtimer played by Richard Widmark. For just a moment, we are given hope that this film will end triumphantly. Surely, we think, the youngster's spunky attitude will rub off on the cynic and change him for the better.  Forlorn hope! Instead, the cynic wins the day -- and the youngster's spark is doused forever. ""National Lampoon Goes to the Movies"" and heads right for the toilet, asking us to follow it down the drain. Nominally, this is a comedy. But where's the humor?"
2,"""More Dogs Than Bones"" is a comedy about some crooked cash which gets so doggone lost that no one can find it. Supposed to be a comedy, this dog stumbles clumsily along with a monotonous storyline punctuated with some comic relief which is so bad the only relief is when the film ends. How so many good actors could end up in such an awful film is beyond all reason. Pass on this puppy. (D+)"
2,"BULWORTH (1998) ***1/2  Starring: Warren Beatty, Halle Berry, Don Cheadle, Oliver Platt, Isaiah Washington, and Christine Baranski Directed, produced, and written by Warren Beatty 108 minutes Rated R (for pervasive strong language, drug use, sexual references, and brief violence)   By Blake French:  	I have seen a lot of movies in my time, but I have never seen anything as witty, as twisted, as entertaining, as outrageous, or as original as Warren Beatty's new political satire ""Bulworth."" It is, at times, funny, but at others very dark. I can't recall ever stating that a ""serious comedy,"" is one of the years best films before. That was then, this is now--and ""Bulworth"" is truly one of the better film's of 1998.   	As the movie opens, a US senator named Jay Billington Bulworth, hires a hit man to kill an individual of his desire. The hit man wonders exactly who this person is in which a man of such power wishes to eliminate. As it turns out, Bulworth has paid this hit man to kill his own suicidal self. ""If I'm not dead by Monday, I'm canceling that check."" Bulworth states firmly.  	This is were the outrageous humor begins. During a campaign speech at a local African American church, Bulworth goes seemingly nuts. He begins to tell the citizens the truth about subjects in congress that most politicians would never think of revealing to the general public. His representative, Dennis Murphy, who cares only about getting Bulworth elected, almost faints in shock and disbelief. But you have to understand, these are the last days that Bulworth will be experiencing life, so why not reveal secrets, release envelop pushing information, and start up controversy with the nation with his last breaths.  	""Never make life of death decisions when you're suicidal,"" explains Bulworth during one of the film's more invigoration sequences. He is talking to a woman named Nina, whom he met nonchalantly during one of his presentation speeches. The two of them fall in love. Too bad Bulworth has not taken his own advice typed above, for his death is near. But is Nina who she appears to be? Is his wife, Constance Bulworth, having an affair with another man? Is Bulworth's demise in the near future? All suitable questions that will all be answered when you see the movie.   	Parts of the film do not work. For instance, the subplot involving Bulworth's wife who is adulterous just isn't detailed enough, nor are the characters introduced, for us to even consider this anything but a gimmick. True, the affair does symbolize chaos preoccupied in his household, and establishes another reason for him to be suicidal. Still, it's too small for a movie that offers so many good qualities.   	""Bulworth"" has a detailed opening that provokes empathy for our main character, Jay Bulworth. We learn of an external problem, Jay being involved in a heated presidential campaign, and an internal problem, Jay being suicidal and calling a hit on himself. The structure only goes uphill from there, and that is hard to do. Both conflicts are evolved, with Nina, Bulworth's sense of honesty, the hit man's presence, and several character & plot twists in which someone is not who they appear to be.  	Along with some very dramatic and meaningful moments found in ""Bulworth,"" also contained is dialogue that is smart, witty, and at times hilarious. The first shock value sequence is truly outrageous, and the films unabashed sense of eagerness only gets more perverse; the film is rated R for appropriate reasons, mostly coming from Bulworth's style of life he becomes involved with. The situations we're facing here are quite controversial, but Warren Beatty directs the film with a certain humorous touch. He uses effective but bizarre camera angles, and a hip cinematographer that creates aggressive chemistry between Beatty and Halle Berry during their ""party animal"" scenes together.   	The performances in ""Bulworth"" entirely demonstrate that Warren Beatty is not only able to direct, write and produce well, but also that capable to lead an all star cast, including Don Cheadle, Oliver Platt, Isaiah Washington, and Christine Baranski, into an Oscar worthy overall appearance level. All of these things contribute to making ""Bulworth"" is of the better films of 1998, and I recommend it highly.   Brought to you by Twentieth Century Fox."
2,"All the versions of the Runyon story are very good. It's just a great story, but this one is clearly the best. A seemingly heartless, stingy bookie accepts a little girl as a marker for a bet, but when the girl's father is killed by notorious gangsters, the bookie, Sorrowful Jones, is stuck with her. The events that follow range from hysterically funny to emotionally provoking. And those qualities are enhanced by great talents. Bob Hope is perfect as the stingy bookie, playing to his usual role. Bruce Cabot does well as the evil gangster, and Lucille Balllands another great role (she had to have the best agent in the business) as the mother figure. But the little girl, Martha Jane Smith, is absolutely divine as the sad faced girl that even makes Bob Hope melt. She is just zillions of times cuter and more emotion provoking than the bland Shirley Temple. If you don't believe me, see for yourself. A classic that need to come to AMC instead of those stupid boring movies they keep showing (Arnie movies, Stallone movies, Friday 13 movies, etc). How about showing real classics like this instead, something people will watch and enjoy!"
0,"I once used Wesley Snipes' name as a clue to go ahead and watch a new, untried film in which he appears. So now, for the first time, my Snipes-Method of film recommendation has failed. Utterly. I should first have come here to see these reviews.  Snipes ought to be ashamed to allow his otherwise earnest efforts to be so wasted in ""The Contractor"".  One of my worst flick fears has come to bitter fruition. I feared that the shaky, blurry, pseudo-documentary, ""unconsidered"" directing and editing style (first brought to my attention by the Paul Greengrass-directed ""Bloody Sunday"") might propagate to other films. Greengass' sickening style was then brought to nauseatingly new heights in the last two of the Bourne trilogy films. My fear had come to pass. In my opinion, these films are made really bad by these motion-sickness-inducing methods, which mistake blurry swipes for ""action-enhancement"". But the ""Bourne Franchise,"" as Greengrass so loving calls his cash cow, apparently convinced others in Hollywood to go unprofessional in the quest for fast, big bucks.  Read my lips, you Hollywood types. Action needs to be clearly photographed and presented, not merely hinted at by poor, lazy cinematographic techniques.  And ""The Contractor"" goes so far as to emulate ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" in inanely-repeated sound bites, in hopes their juvenile (apparently-evaluated) audiences can't sense them. For example, if I hear a cop radio crackling ""Yankee-Romeo"" one more time, I'll just scream. The chances are good I won't hear it again: I certainly won't ever view ""The Contractor"" again.  I recommend to those of you who have yet to see ""The Contractor"": just be content with the tranquility this lack affords to your life.  2 out of 10; I am tempted to lower that to a 1."
2,"I can never wrap my head around the careers of Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant. On television, their work is some of the best comedy of the past couple of decades: The State, Viva Variety!, and, their triumph, Comedy Central's Reno 911. But when they write movies, the results are well nigh unwatchable. I had thought in the past that they were just defecating cheap movie scripts so that they could make money and continue producing fine work on television. I mean, The Pacifier, Herbie: Fully Loaded and Night at the Museum smack of the kind of audience-despising material you might expect from smart writers deliberately trying to dumb down their work for some cold hard cash. Add to that the fact that their movie version of Reno 911, which was released early in 2007, was pretty good. But then, later in the year, they made this film. It's a cheesy little comedy, and it has a lot of potential to be decent, if unremarkable, fun. This is their genre, unlike the children's flicks. There's no conceivable reason to hate your audience here, since presumably they'll be pretty close to the same audience that watches Reno 911. Dan Fogler plays a former child prodigy and Olympic table tennis player. Now he's a loser, but he's being recruited by the FBI to infiltrate an underground ping-pong tournament, hosted by an international criminal, played by Christopher Walken. The premise, reminiscent of other recent underground sports comedies like Dodgeball and Beerfest, doesn't have a lot of promise, it's true. But all a comedy really needs is some good jokes, and it'll fly. Or at least you'd think it would. The problem with Balls of Fury isn't exactly its jokes. They're funny enough, for the most part. It's the delivery. The actors have little ability in comic timing (what halfway decent comedic director would willfully hire George Lopez to be in their movie?), and Robert Ben Garant often fails to sell the jokes, even when they are potentially amusing. Even when the comic performances are good, as is the case with Walken and co-writer Thomas Lennon himself, the editing is so poor that the gags almost never hit. It's all quite maddening. Reno 911 is particularly brilliant in its editing. I really don't see how the same people could produce such a laughless comedy. I guess TV is just their medium, but I don't understand why film-making should prove so difficult for them."
2,"A crazed computer genius named Goad (Laura San Giacomo) sets a spaceship named the Agamemnon, loaded to the gills with an highly unstable substance, on a collision course with the Earth! The Agamemnon has been encoded by Goad to start on its preprogrammed destination once it is revived by a salvage team. J.T. Wayne (Sandra Bernhard) is the Captain of the Salbor, the salvage ship that undertakes said mission. Things go awry for the Captain however when a portion of her assembled crew lead by her former lover, a cutthroat type named Vendler, double-crosses her and looks to gain the valuable Solarium aboard the ship for himself. However he didn't count on Goad's reprogramming of the ship's systems. Yet even in the face of defeat, Vendler refuses to give up his hold on the ship or listen to reason or logic. Now as the clock ticks down to a collision with the Earth, Wayne and her new crewman, a former bartender named Lennon (Cameron Dye), must try and find a means of stopping the Agamemnon or millions on Earth will die!   Well I have to admit this is competently made. They keep the action moving nicely along and the visuals often prove distracting and interesting. The whole concept with Goad shows some level of originality and I enjoyed Laura San Giacomo's performance as a crazed computer programming genius who has a God complex and an obsession with quoting Shakespeare. Where this falters is when our story changes its focus to J.T. Wayne, played by an horrifically miscast Sandra Bernhard who constantly uses the catchphrase ""And Don't You Forget It!"" and basically goes all out to put off any male in the movie, including the man who is supposed to be her love interest. The failed attempts at humor in the film are far more likely to make viewers shake their heads in disbelief than cause them to laugh. In fact, this film frequently has this effect on any viewer who can manage to sit through the whole thing. To me, it is this element of ""I just cannot believe what I am watching"" that makes this so bad it's almost good."
0,"Basically, Cruel Intentions 2 is Cruel Intentions 1, again, only poorly done. The story is exactly the same as the first one (even some of the lines), with only a few exceptions. The cast is more unknown, and definitely less talented. Instead of being seductive and drawing me into watching it, I ended up feeling dirty because it compares to watching a soft-core porn. I'm not sure whether to blame some of the idiotic lines on the actors or the writers...and I always feel bad saying that, because I know how hard it is to do both...but it was basically a two-hour waste of my life. It literally amazes me that some movies get made, and this is no exception...I can't believe they'd make a third one."
2,"I got REALLY excited when I saw this movie in a Blockbuster one day. I kept telling people I wanted to see it really badly...as the title is my name. I finally caught up with this movie about a month ago and was thoroughly disappointed.  It cracks me up that so many say that people who don't like the movie just didn't understand it's ""brilliance."" I understood what was going on. I got the ""twist"" ending where everything ends up being a sad delusion. The fact is, it just wasn't that great.  People kept asking how the psych was also the nanny. In her delusional world, all the characters still had parts. The psychiatrist visits weren't real, just like none of the life after the accident was real. These are known as coping mechanisms. She was trying to cope with the loss and pain, so she created an alternate reality in her mind.  At the end of the movie, you get the real story.  TBH, I enjoyed it at first, but at the end, I felt like I had just wasted that time. It's rare for me to say that about a movie. I can almost ALWAYS find something I like. I really WANTED this movie to be good, but the the whole point didn't seem very original to me, and I feel like I've seen twists like this done a lot better.  There just weren't any redeeming qualities about this film. Itw as awful."
2,"First off, people need to stop ranking every Kim Ki Duk movie relative to others. It's not like you see a Stanley Kubrick film, and then say it is OK but is not as good as Doctor Strangelove.  This film delves into some of the basic themes he raises in his other movies, jealousy, male desire, etc...  The basic plot is that an old man has raised a baby girl until she is about to sexually develop, so she is now a teenager. He has raised her on his boat. He takes people out on fishing trips, needless to say the guys out on the trips take a liking to her, finally a young man comes who she seems to fancy.  The basic question is then whether the old man will be able to prevent her from falling in love with this young guy. The name ""The Bow"" comes from a bow he uses to ward off her potential suitors.  Think of that scene in James Dean's ""Rebel Without a Cause"" where the father of Dean's love interest becomes angry when she still wants to have close physical affection with him, you can tell that buried beneath he has desires for his daughter, and hence he becomes easily angry and strikes out at her.  So this is the basic psychoanalytical insight of attraction between father and daughter and the taboo at acts to prevent it from going any further.  There is also the age aspect. This old man still desires, but it's plainly obvious that the girl is much to young for him, and that he cannot compete with younger men. So there is a love triangle, affection between daughter and father, the weakness of age, and other foundational themes.  This movie will be a appreciated by Kim Ki Duk fans, and anyone who approaches it with an open and non-judgmental mind."
2,"This largely unknown Italian horror movie encapsulates the best of Italian horror. We've got Giallo elements, supernatural elements, surreal ambiance and a dark, sinister plot. Despite a lovely murder scene that takes place in the middle of a load of bed sheets, the first half of the film is largely rather uninspiring; but as the film moves on, it mutates into one of the most grisly assaults that I've ever seen from Italy. Many people that have seen this movie have labelled it a Giallo, and while the film does have it's Giallo moments in the first half - I'd put Spider Labyrinth in with the robust Gothic horror films such as Kill Baby Kill, Inferno and Suspiria before listing it amongst the likes of Solange and The Bird With the Crystal Plumage. The plot follows a professor who is sent to stay with a fellow professor for reasons that are always left rather vague. It's not long before his professor host ends up dead, and our hero is being plunged into a world of mystery and sinister cults, which all seems to focus around some strange 'fist-sized' black balls.  Italian horror is well known for not making a lot of sense and this film suffers from a screenplay that adheres to that 'rule'. The intrigue is generated towards the start mainly because of the fact that the film is so difficult to follow, but once the film enters it's more satisfying second half, these problems are somewhat resolved. Even while the film isn't making a whole lot of sense, however, it still remains interesting by way of its atmosphere. Atmosphere tends to be more important in this sort of film anyway, so the fact that this one relies on it is largely to its credit. The beautiful Italian locations are well shot and the lighting in the scenes indoors gives the film exactly the right mood. The underground scenes towards the end represent the film's strongest location shoots, and are one of the main reasons why it ultimately succeeds. The special effects look extremely cheap and are mostly stop-motion. However, they're really disgusting also, and the final scene; even though the 'monster' is a doll, really is nightmarish. Overall, I could easily understand anyone that doesn't like Spider Labyrinth; but it hit the nail on the head for me, and I definitely recommend it to my fellow Italian horror cinema fans!"
2,"I saw this film when it first came out. I liked it then and I like it now. Some argue that its a little too heavy on the patriotism. But if you remember it was made at a time when we weren't sure how the war would come out, the context keeps patriotism in perspective. Back then most everyone supported the war effort and the doubters kept their doubts to themselves. There were virtually no families without at least one member in the service and most of the non-service people worked in defense jobs. ""So Proudly We Hail"" was a timely film when it was made and 60+ years later its message is still relevant as an historical event."
2,"This was a great film! How anyone else can say otherwise is beyond me... I think it is a fine tribute to relief workers and others around the world who both in the present and in the past have risked their lives (and I am sure many a time their sanity) trying to lend a hand in hopeless, horrible places and situations (where people are starving to death, or are displaced because of war, or are dying of preventative diseases, etc. etc. etc.) Angelina Jolie and Clive Owen are spectacular, and portray very well the constant obstacles and risks involved with just SIMPLY TRYING TO HELP OTHERS IN NEED AROUND THE WORLD (whether it be trying to acquire funding from rich and powerful people and countries, or having to negotiate with warlords and governments just to get supplies through, etc., etc.). The movie is never ""over-the-top"" or ""unrealistic"" and stays very grounded and real throughout the whole thing. ABSOLUTELY A ""10"" ON ANY SCALE!"
1,"I saw this movie with a bunch of friends and although only two of us walked out of the cinema thinking how cool it was, the others just laughed and commented on how stupid it was. Well that was because it isn't supposed to be taken so seriously, basically it is a a movie that mocks horror flicks and does a damn good job.. There seems to be another movie coming out like that too, umm... Scary Movie?? Well this is Aussie, and original!!! Jessica Napier does a surperb performance and Sarah Kants has a definate bright future in acting! I hope to see more of them. Molly Ringwald was a good move, and Kylie was an even better move. The Impossible Princess was Queen of the screen!! I recommend seeing this flick, as you'll be guessing until the very end the connection with Raffy, Hilary and The movie that never got finished 20 years ago."
1,"This is a gem of a movie not just for people who like fun and quirky premises, but who love the history and traditions of Sci-Fi and Classic Hollywood movies. Each alien of the Martian crew is the embodiment of a classic Sci-Fi character or member of Hollywood royalty and it's pure pleasure watching them bounce of each other and the residents of Big Bean."
1,"I've been reading through some of the other user comments and decided to put one in too. Some of the users are stuck in a 'realist' type of mentality. This film was meant to be a 'fantasy'....a 'what if' fun film. It was never meant to be 'real' or serious. It was thoroughly enjoyable for everyone I knew when it came out - even though it shadowed the tragedy of the Challenger explosion...I was 30 at the time and totally enjoyed this one - my young son loved it too! Later, I shared it with my daughter and she, too, loved it. SpaceCamp is a fun family film that should be enjoyed for just that - fun. All the 'realists' in the world should lighten up or stick to watching documentaries or docudramas and avoid any other type of film. So sorry for those young folks who watched this movie first and then were able to go to the real SpaceCamp (one in Alabama and one at Vandenberg AFB in California) - they must have gone expecting to find the same type of environment that was portrayed in the movie and then felt 'letdown'...I guess their parents didn't explain the difference between fantasy and reality. Oh well. If you love fantasy-fun films and haven't seen this one, I highly recommend it! Enjoy!"
1,"This is an intimate movie of a sincere girl in the real world out of Hollywood's cheap fantasy is a very good piece of its class, and Ashley Judd fills the role impeccably. It may appear slow for thrill seekers though. Cool movie for a calm night.  "
2,"First off this movie is supposed to be a compelling adventure about a few brave men protecting endangered antelopes from poachers.   What they don't tell you is, in the course of shooting this movie they are actually shooting real antelope. Granted these aren't the ""endangered"" animals they are protecting in the plot but a similar antelope breed with fake antlers glued to it. With 6 views of antelopes being killed consistently and bleeding out made it hard for me to believe there message.  Hypocritical doesn't begin to summarize this movie. If I was you I wouldn't waste my time or money.  I mean real antelopes being killed in a movie about stopping people from killing them? These writers should feel ashamed."
1,"The Theory Of Flight is an engaging character study of an artist (Branagh) yearning to break free of boredom and mediocrity, and a terminally ill patient (Bonham-Carter) in the last stages of ASL, confined to a wheelchair, who desires to make love to a man before dying.  Helena Bonham-Carter exudes wit, defiance, and independence as an ASL patient who is virtually dependent upon people around her to take care of her.  Kenneth Branagh, sentenced through community service to take part in caring for her, complements Helena's charm with woeful melancholy, creating a sentimental, compelling love story in which two people try to help each other find the road to happiness, before time runs out."
2,"A cheap movie - and not only because it is low budget. The action pretends to be about a cheating scheme in the high tech capitalist venture world. It actually is just confusing and predictable at the same time. Directing and camera work are close to ridicule, and acting does not get higher than low quality TV dramas. Steve Baldwin is shaming the Baldwin name by participating in this movie. Even the erotic scenes seem to be just there to fill in the time. 4/10 on my personal scale. Avoid it!"
0,"Realistic movie,sure,except for the fact that the characters don't look like to be scared. When Billy Zane tries to kill someone, he feels bad...but he doesn't look like to. That's why I don't like his performance in this movie. Tom Berenger is again playing a soldier. No good thrill, realistic sequences. Not always shooting, that is one great thing. Well filmed. I hate the helicopter sequence, cause only one terrorist kills almost the whole marine bunch...I give it **and a half out of *****"
2,"Not recommended for diabetics or anybody over the age of four.  This sickly-sweet, cloying piece of tripe has all the depth and feeling of a third-rate greeting card. If your kid insists on seeing it (I presume at a friend's house, since you will have better taste than to bring this into your home), there's no harm in it. There's just nothing to gain but smarmy platitudes the kid should be learning from you anyway."
1,"I watched this movie after seeing it on Broadway. I love the Broadway musical and I love the movie. I watched the movie like it was not related to the Broadway show. I am an avid reader and have seen what happens to most books when they are turned into movies, so I developed a philosophy really early. Assume that the movie is going to be based on the book ( or musical in this case) but that while the story line may be similar it will not be the same, it will be different so watch it for what it is.  I danced for 12 years before I had to make a choice. I was a good dancer( picking up chorus work in local productions as a child etc) but I wasn't super talented.I was however super talented as a show rider. I was told by my dance instructor and my trainer ( who i spent several months a year at his farm out of state) that I had to make a choice when I turned 14. That I needed to move up from dancing two hours four-five days a week and riding 3 hours a day 7 days a week.. and dedicate to one or the other. So I dearly love dancing and I love this movie and a lot of the other ballet and dance movies. I just chose to watch this movie for what it is, it is a great movie about raw emotion and human interaction. It is about the power of anticipation and heartbreak when you work really hard to get something you want and you just do not get it. I love the movie. I love the Broadway musical."
2,"WARNING SPOILERS: This review is from the point of view of one who would rather we live in a world without Mafias, organized crime, and gangs. From the perspective of crime itself, I can almost admire the cat burgler, the bank robber, or even the pickpocket, whereas I find organized crime to be vile, albeit efficient. Regarding violence itself, I much prefer the old-style, manlier ways of settling scores such as showdowns, brawls, and duels instead of use of hit men, goons, and sub-machine guns, which may keep the ""head"" alive, but which reduces the heart.  In this vein, I found a great poignancy within the usual discomfort I have when viewing gangster films. Tom's assertion towards his end, ""I ain't so tough,"" and his hospital apology to his family, showed me that the filmmakers understood this unmanliness, and that organized crime is about greed and cowardice more than necessity and triumph of will. Mike's lecture to Tom concerning Tom's lack of heart and brain also gives pause, so that (if you agree with the filmmakers) one can define very simply the typical gangster's actions. And there is little in the annals of true-life Mafia activity, whether Italian, Korean, Chinese, Negro, or what-have-you, which overthrows this.  In all honesty, I found James Cagney's character to be over-the-top, in the usual Hollywood fashion (other examples: Joe Pesci, James Caan), and his mobster actions were predictable, for the most part. This jibed well with my disgusted side. On the other hand, Glasmon and Bright (the writers) explore some complicated issues which touched me greatly. This may be due to Bright's first-hand experiences with gangsters.  First, Tom's ""purity"" while in a relationship with Gwen (Jean Harlow). This adult content surprised me, especially for a 1931 action movie, and one of the first talkies. When Jane (Mia Marvin) seduces a drunken Tom, their morning-after becomes not only a surprising slap in the face for all concerned (including the viewer), but also sets up the motivation for Matt's (Edward Doyle) demise.  Second, Tom's relationship with his brother is very provocative. There is the usual macho posturing of right vs. wrong, but there are also undercurrents of gray areas. Who is worse: Tom, for bootlegging, or Mike for petty embezzlement? Tom, for being an enforcer, or Mike, for indiscriminate killing during wartime? Naturally, the case can be made that Mike's heroics pave the way for the free country which Tom enjoys, but this is never explored, merely left to conjecture. Quite pleasing, from both a cinematic and literary standpoint. The content of this counterpoint was present but not overbearing.  Third, there is the possibility that Tom is sexually-oriented in two ways. I'm not in any way trying to foist such opinions on anyone, but it seems to me that Putty-Nose's (Murray Kinnell) butt is awfully close to Tom's face during the pool-room scene early in the movie. Also, why is Tom ""not the marrying kind"" and why does he harbor such obvious distaste for most women? It's certainly not due to his sweet mother, or benign sister-in-law. I'm not FOR these types of references or innuendo, but I merely point it out as possible.  Fourth is the searing commentary on Prohibition itself, and how it was that a combination of governmental and temperance forces allowed opportunity to knock for those with little conscience (even if Paddy {Robert Emmett O'Connor} is made to be an honorable man here).  These, however, are side issues to the film. The action itself is bearable and fluid. The making of the small-time hustler into sweeping gangster is not fully-explored, but merely assumed, and then there is an alternating mega- and micro-look into that crooked world. We see glimpses of thievery, crooked business deals, strong-arm protection and racketeering, cold-blooded murder, and revenge. Then, we are privy to the inner workings of mob mentality, the unbreakable friendships, the gun molls, the hideouts. Little attention is paid here to law enforcement, and the regular Joe and the media are fashioned to be in sympathy with the mobs, a likely by-product of the ""wetness"" which rumrunners brought to those otherwise-""dry"" times.  All in all, I enjoyed this movie, with its many messages, visuals, and vignettes. Cagney is a great actor, although this is not his pivotal work. Harlow is sultry in a minor role. Woods is extremely likable as Tom's compatriot. Joan Blondell brings some of her bubbliness to these drab surroundings. Donald Cook is wonderfully-old-school in his eye-rolling part. Beryl Mercer as Ma Powers also evokes some surprisingly-good emoting.  Overall, I think you will enjoy this."
2,"This is the story of Clarence Mumford, a struggling dreamer / Robitussin addict who's only hope in life is of one day becoming a great ninja. His parents discourage him, his girlfriend cheats on him, and he is constantly getting beat up. Then one day, when his resolve reaches its lowest, he is contacted by a powerful sensei from Japan who tells him he must travel there and learn the art of the ninja from him. So he goes, and after one of the most brilliant montages ever, hes able to return home a ninja, though like a lot of kung-fu films he still doubts his true ability. To become a master ninja he must conquer his self doubt, and in fitting fashion there is a showdown in which he proves himself, and wins back the woman. All of this is embellished around superb acting, action packed choreography, a disregard for continuity, and a highly stylized joie de vivre thats quite personal, fans of Hicks know what I mean.  The dialog is all over dubbed, and the OST pushes the story along backed to a cliché 80's glam sound. What is not too love about this movie?... I used to think Hitchcock was a master, then I saw what Bill Hicks could do."
1,"Screwball comedy about romantic mismatches in New York City. Peter Bogdanovich is obviously in love with all the women in his picture--he reveres them--yet Audrey Hepburn is (naturally) put a notch above the others because, after all, she's the princess Bogdanovich probably fell in love with at the movies 30 years prior. He shoots her in loving close-ups, gets right in the sheets between her and a wonderfully hard-boiled/soft-boiled Ben Gazzara, and allows her room to sparkle throughout. The love-connections made in the course of the film are fast and amusing, though I did tire of John Ritter's TV-styled klutziness. Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten, and the grounded, earthy-sensual Patti Hansen are all exciting to watch. But it's really Hepburn's valentine and she absolutely glows. *** from ****"
2,"I'm am going to give this movie a ten, yes a ten.. Mike Myers is a genius and whether this movie was his best or worst it made me laugh and it was original. It was very silly and that's a good thing, I guess what helped is I saw him on Inside the Actors Studio and he explained his thoughts on how he put the movie together and was pretty open about the raw humor etc. in the film. It has a lot of raunchy humor and it's not so different then the Austin Power movies in the way it's put together. Yes Vern Troyer is in it.... I think you really have to see it for yourself. If you like wait a few months and it will be out on DVD... People on here take these movies these days way to serious I remember when going to see a movie was supposed to be fun, not always on IMDb.com, lol Have Fun. Tom"
2,"This movie is from the period when Rick Moranis and Steve Martin were still at the very top of the comedy-genre. This movie shows both of them in top-form and they make this movie a fun and certainly above average one.  It's not the most clever or best comedy movie even written but the movie does serve its purpose. There are quite many different plot-lines. It doesn't make the movie confusing to watch but it does make it a little bit less interesting to watch at times. Therefor the move never really reaches the level of true greatness but it still is a bit of a forgotten and certainly underrated comedy that deserves some more recognition.  This movie features Steve Martin in one of his best and most entertaining roles. He is perfect as the ex-gangster, who now is in the witness protection program. He goes perfectly over-the-top as the Italian wise-guy. Rick Moranis' role is a bit smaller (too small) but not any less entertaining because of that. Moranis and Martin form a pretty good and funny comical duo, mainly because the two characters are very different from each other. The movie also has a really strong supporting cast, with some big and well known respected names in it.  It's a movie that really mostly relies on its two main character. They make the movie and its comedy moments work. The movie doesn't really have that many memorable moments, although the dance sequences are definitely fun, original and amusing. Its more the sort of movie that amuses and entertaining throughout its entire running time, without making a too big or lasting impression. The movie tries to be clever at moments with its story but it only succeeds partly in this. The story is too messy and too disconnected to make it really fully work.  There are too many issues with this movie to really regard it as a great comedy classic. The story is not always told in the most interesting way and not everything in the movie really connects with each other. Also the ending was a bit of a disappointment. It was like they wanted to solve every plot line and problems in the last ten minutes in just a couple of sequences. It made the ending a bit of a too easy and unsatisfying one.  Overall an entertaining, bit of underrated comedy, that is fun to watch, mainly thanks to Martin and Moranis who were both in top shape at the time of this movie.  7/10"
2,"""Dark"" is right: this is a dark movie with dark people and dark buildings where there is no daylight until the very end of the story. It's a combination sci-fi/film noir and takes place back in the 1940s or '50s in some big city.  It's alien nonsense stuff about peoples' memories taken from them so that the aliens can learn enough about earth beings to eventually take over their souls because their own race is dying, blah, blah, blah. You've seen it before.   However, the story takes a back seat to the set designs and special effects, both of which are unique. I know of no other movie, before or since (it's been eight years), which shows a city literally re-shape itself each night with buildings expanding, rising, falling, etc. The visuals throughout this movie are fabulous and the sounds that go with it are good, too.   There is very little profanity in this movie but it's still an ugly, sordid story and not always fun to watch even though it keeps your attention and - at least with me - draws you back for multiple viewings. There is a magnetism to this film. This is the only video I got rid twice and re-acquired it both times! As I said, Dark City keeps drawing me back. Eerie!!!"
2,"This movie stinks!!! What is all the hype about? It deserved no awards, no festival fanfare, no attention whatsoever. It's so boring, pretentious and incompetent it doesn't even deserve to be released! 13 Seconds is just another shot on video, no budget loser put in a nice, shiny box to fool you into thinking there might be some production value or creativity behind it. But... nothing happens in this film (certainly nothing interesting or remotely scary). The special effects are laughable and few and far between. The acting is terrible (especially the hillbilly fat guy with the funny hair cut) and to top it off, everyone is so badly DUBBED in post it looks like a kung-fu movie from the '70s whenever anybody opens their big, ugly mouth (and they sound like their dialogue was rerecorded in an empty warehouse for all the echo on it). Do we really need another rotten horror movie about a rock-n-roll band? Did we learn nothing from the 1980s and films like Hard Rock Zombies or Black Roses? Watching this movie for even ""13 seconds"" is a waste of time. Shame on Lion's Gate for releasing this timid, wet fart of a horror movie! I give it a ""1"" only because the rating system doesn't go any lower... Avoid 13 Seconds like the plague!"
2,"This is a musical with some marvelous Rogers & Hammerstein songs, but they are mere accoutrements for Agnes DeMille's sagebrush ballets. Every step is artistically perfect. The result is magnificent for choreography students and dance afficienados but tremendously slow for the rest of us. Rod Steiger is much too affected in his role. Gordon McRae is adequate,, but Shirley Jones and Eddie Albert come off as most memorable in an impressive, albeit overstuffed, cast. Altogether, this is great art, dance, and music, but a so-so movie."
2,"*Really awful war movie! So why didn't I just turn it off when Van Johnston turned up as a British air marshall. I mean, John Wayne would have been much better. Some of the Dunquerque scenes are pretty good. And a lot of things --- and people --- get blown up. But it's a parade of cliche characters and predictable plot turns. Indeed it's such a bomb that if the Luftwaffe had had a few prints of it and had dropped them on London, they might have won the Battle of Britain. But I wouldn't wish that on the British people. I gave it a three and that only because I was in an exceptionally generous frame of mind.  "
2,"I just saw this film and consider it to be one of the best anti-war films I've seen in quite a long time. And that makes me wonder at what the various critics are thinking. Roger Ebert gets it right, but some film critics are far too dismissive of a very serious, important film. James Berardinelli, in particular, seems curiously _angry_ that this film depicts the moral degradation of war in a frank and honest fashion.  Berardinelli is basically wrong in every single thing he says about the film. Since this film is not a ""politcal message"" film, it has no requirement to ""show both sides equally"". It is a story about a group of soldiers basically driven beyond the area of traditionally human behavior. Berardinelli thinks that it's ""obvious"" that war changes the way people feel about their country.  I sense a person utterly detached from history when I read that. A recent study concluded that the English were, as a group, fairly happy during WWII, even when their nation was under attack. Why was that? Because they believed in what they were doing. The notion that war _necessarily_ results in moral breakdown is, while hardly novel, also not true. That is part of what is important about ""Elah"". Jones' character is a veteran of the Vietnam war, and is hardly a delicate flower when it comes to the matters of war and its effect on the psyche. And yet even he is floored at what the Iraq war has done to the soldiers.  It is easy for a film critic to simply reject what is essentially reporting on the state of the military today. That Berardinelli does so with such vitriol makes me guess that he is injecting his own bias into the review."
2,"Unike its titular child android, ""Astro Boy""'s oh-so earnest zing is somewhat attenuated by the lack of a definitive soul to make it stand out. Which isn't to say that David Bowers' 3-D animated sci-fi is a screwed-up experience -- thanks largely to its amusing one-liners and side characters -- but its theme of a boy trying to fit in among those who are different from him fail to stand up to the likes of, say, ""Pinocchio,"" and ""Iron Giant.""   In the lustrously hi-tech Metro, a city floating above piles and piles of metal scraps, humans are served by robots that are guided by the late Isaac Asimov's robotic laws. Metro resident Toby (voiced by Freddie Highmore) is seeking to follow in the footsteps of his father, Dr. Tenma (Nicolas Cage), who created most of the city's machines. However, an accident that leads to Toby's death prompts the sorrowing dad to create a robot in Toby's image in a bid to replace his son. Astro, as the mechanical Toby eventually becomes known, is shattered after Dr. Tenma rejects him for not being able to live up to his human counterpart, and realizing that he's not who he thinks he is, Astro leaves the Metro in search of a place where he feels he'll belong.  Bowers' cinematic translation of a 1951 manga by Osamu Tezuka is an uneven -- albeit beaming -- trip, typified by the likes of Cage and Bill Nighy who sound bored, even if Donald Sutherland and Kristen Bell feel game for their roles. But it succeeds in creating an allegory on the rift between different classes, even if they are frustratingly glossed over in service of a predictable story and a few humdrum action. Despite its shortcomings, ""Astro Boy"" still proves humorously compelling when its hero spreads kindness courtesy of his cant-do-bad heart."
2,"I would like to mention a different side of the movie that sheds light on Sufi or Mevlevi orders in Turkish and Islamic history.  Why Muharrem is selected for this task to perform financial affairs of the order? The answer is related with the stages of knowledge or purity that one has to qualify to become a ""Perfect Human Being"" or ""insan-i kamil"" in Turkish. This concept or ideology is rooted with Islamic tradition. Many Sufi or Mevlevi order has this process for their dervishes which may take a lifetime to achieve this goal or even never be able to reach that level of ""perfection"".  Different than being nun or monk which requires leaving mainstream society and living in the monastery with prayers, last step of this difficult and lengthy process of purifying one's soul from earthly desires, is to be able to return to the real world after so many years lived in contemplation and yet not being disturbed with its appeal to commit sin. I believe in the last few minutes head of the order explains this a little bit. And apparently Muharrem failed to accomplish last stage before achieving ""perfection""."
0,"A man wakes from a nightmare about bats. He and his wife go out into the desert for a picnic on their honeymoon. He seems to hear a strange noise, and she is disturbed by the sight of a bat crawling across their picnic blanket. He wants to go on a tour of a cave, which has something to do with some kind of work he is doing, but she wants to enjoy their honeymoon. She relents. They go on the tour, but leave the group to make out. She falls down a slope, where she is disturbed by insects. He follows her. He hears the strange noise again, and seems to know a bat is approaching; one does, and gets in her hair. He fights it off her, and it attacks him, biting his forehead.  They get out of the cave, but when they are in a gondola at a ski resort, he starts having seizures in which he has hallucinations or visions of bats attacking people. He becomes angry when this happens. He's unable to drink alcohol without spitting it out. His wife worries about rabies, and he starts a Pasteur treatment for that, but reacts violently to the injection.  And then some people are killed. We see parts of the man's transformation into a bat person. It seems it is not just in his mind. Whether the bat bite causes these transformations is not clear, since he already was having some symptoms prior to the bite.  While the title seems inappropriate, the implication at the end is that the same thing is happening to another person. Not a very good movie, but I liked the variety of the desert, cave, and ski-slope locations, and some of the weirder scenes. I didn't think this was as bad as other people do, and I didn't think the 1999 movie Bats was as bad as others think either (I rated that one a 5/10)."
2,"This is an excellent movie. I had to hunt it down while visiting LA, but Judy Berlin is definitely worth catching. Eddie Falco, Barbara Barrie, and Madeline Kahn are excellent leading ladies. Kahn especially makes an impact as a worrisome and somewhat philosophical housewife who goes on a long walk during the eclipse. Beautifully shot in black and white, Judy Berlin is wonderful, definitely one of my favorite movies. Too bad it didn't get a wider release."
2,"I must confess to liking giant monster movies, but this film is really just plain awful! Bad special effects, even worse acting, silly premise. By the way that big snake would be considered a monster! Anyway painful as it was I made it through to the end. I chuckled a few times while watching this mess, just not believing what I'm seeing or hearing.  1 out of 10, for bad movies beware 5 out of 10. Suffer with me."
1,"A very strange and compelling movie. It's about a very awkward and tightly wound man who attempts to navigate his life as a door-to-door fundraiser/salesman. The director was able to capture a very unnerving tone that really served the story well. Original and unsettling while also finding a great deal of humor in the pain that accompanies life. There is a sequence at a testing facility that really stood out and made me laugh out loud which is not something I do as frequently as I should. One of the more memorable films I've seen in a long while. Hasn't left my mind and I look forward to future efforts by Bronstein. Fantastic performances all around. The simple line ""I really appreciate it."" is now iconic to me."
2,"Good fight scenes. Deborah Richter looks pretty good, especially when she's at the beach stark naked. Also later when she briefly shows her boobs. If anybody but Cannon had produced this movie, it would have been better. The best thing that ever happened to the movie industry was Cannon going bankrupt. They ruined everything they touched (Superman IV, Death Wish 4). In this movie they also totally blew away any believability. The stupidest sequence was when Van Damme gets crucified (hanging by ropes with nails in his wrists). He hangs there for at least a day, then gets angry and kicks the cross down he's hanging on. It falls, Richter finds him and frees him. Then, they somehow catch up to the bad guys and he's in better fighting shape than ever. Yeah right. Fiction is defined as the willing suspension of disbelief. I don't think anyone can willingly suspend that much. I have seen worse movies, and I didn't fall asleep watching it. That and Deborah Richter's nudity are why I give it a 3 instead of a zero."
1,"This show is so full of action, and everything needed to make an awsome show.. but best of all... it actually has a plot (unlike some of those new reality shows...). It is about a transgenic girl who escapes from her military holding base.. I totally suggest bying the DVDs, i've already preordered them... i suggest you do to..."
1,"Back in the day of the big studio system, the darndest casting decisions were made. Good old all American James Stewart appearing as a Hungarian in The Shop Around the Corner. Had I been casting the film, the part of Kralik would have been perfect for Charles Boyer. His accent mixed in with all the other European accents would have been nothing. Stewart had some of the same problem in the Mortal Storm also with Margaret Sullavan.  Margaret Sullavan was his most frequent leading lady on the screen, he did four films with her. But is only this one where neither of them dies. Sullavan and her husband Leland Heyward knew Stewart back in the day when he was a struggling player in New York. In fact Sullavan's husband was Stewart's good friend Henry Fonda back then.  I think only Clark Gable was able to carry off being an American in a cast of non-Americans in Mutiny on the Bounty. Stewart in The Mortal Storm was German, but all the other players were American as well so nothing stood out.   But if you can accept Stewart, than you'll be seeing a fine film from Ernest Lubitsch. The plot is pretty simple, a man and woman working in a department store in Budapest don't get along in person. But it seems that they are carrying on a correspondence with some anonymous admirers which turn out to be each other. Also employer Frank Morgan suspects Stewart wrongly of kanoodling with his wife.   Though the leads are fine and Frank Morgan departs from his usual befuddled self, the two players who come off best are Felix Bressart and Joseph Schildkraut. Bressart has my favorite moments in the film when he takes off after Morgan starts asking people for opinions. He makes himself very scarce.  And Joseph Schildkraut, who is always good, is just great as the officious little worm who is constantly kissing up to Frank Morgan. You really hate people like that, I've known too many like Schildkraut in real life who are at office politics 24 hours a day. Sad that it pays off a good deal of the time."
2,"amateurish space trash.  politically retarded; scientifically inaccurate; religiously barbaric.  and of course, there's the bad story; bad photography; bad editing; laughably inept dialog.  no point talking about the acting here; these 'professional' actors are reciting lines on cue without any sense that the lines might accumulate into meaningful speech - for the simple reason that it is impossible for them to accumulate into some kind of meaningful speech - it is the usual TV-space-trash babble that people in LSD-flashback really admire.  crap."
2,"I saw this movie yesterday in the San Sebastian Film Festival. I liked the message a lot.A German TV executive has a wake-up call and changes his life ,supporting a culture-driven society.  In these days , TV programs are usually rubbish, and a lot people think in that way, it's difficult to find programs with real interest. So Reclaim your Brain for me is a very good title. We,Citizens, are very tired of this rubbish we are sold day over day. we can change the world!.  But this change is not in the movies, but In our everyday's life.  thank you to all the crew of this movie for doing this picture."
2,"""Show Boat"" is one of those garish musicals from the 1950s where scope and spectacle dwarfed content and story. It's directed lethargically by George Sidney, as if he thought audiences would be so tickled by the elaborate Technicolor sets and costumes that he could just set up his camera and let it run. Said costumes, though this is supposed to be a period piece, have a distinctly late-40s/early-50s flavor. And Ava Gardner is miscast in her role; she sort of vapidly walks through it with little conviction.  It doesn't even do the sterling musical score justice, which is its greatest crime.  Grade: C-"
2,"This movie is so incomprehensibly bad, it hurts to think about... Coming from a fan of crappy action/horror movies this is the stupidest film ever released. The fact that the version I saw was a screener with the name of the company responsible for this atrocity running across the bottom burned the words ""Artisan is satan"" into my brain, FOREVER. also there was no plot and nothing that seemed to want to further the plot in any portion of the damn thing...weak, just utterly weak."
2,"I had pretty high expectations for this film, mainly owing to the interesting cast. But seeing the movie.. man, have I ever been so disappointed!  Sin noticias de Dios is a very pointless, pretentious showcase of previous achievements of popular cinema. There's everything from modern reading of Christian religion (Dogma did this much better and even that flick sucked) to lesbian love (Bound, anyone?), but still it is missing its own point of view and especially any coherence. I can very well imagine how this movie gets five stars in women's magazines and trendy periodicals.  So, if goofy shallowness turns you on, this is your movie, but if you have any respect for yourself and movies with actual content, there are a whole better films to see."
0,"GUERNSEY (Maria Kraakman - Belgium/Netherlands 2005).  The mousy Maria Kraakman plays Anna, a woman in her thirties, who finds out her husband (Fedja van Huet) is cheating on her but she doesn't dare to confront him. She painfully avoids any confrontation with human beings, her parents as well as her sister, so we have a main character in a feature film that doesn't do much at all. We barely know anything about her background or her motivations. Just a woman who seems to be stuck in a blind alley, not just during this difficult episode of her life. She obviously suffers from something, but why do we in the audience have to suffer as well?  I almost gave up on cinema after seeing this unwatchable mess. These were a very dull and painful 90 minutes. Normally I try to avoid wasting energy on bad film making. I'll take the beating and roll with the punches, but in this case a fair warning is in place. How on earth did Nanouk Leopold get funding (in large part from publicly financed funds) for this turkey? Obviously, there was no script to speak off. It could be compensated by an ingenious filmmaker with cinematographic ideas or a cast with only a little more appeal. None whatsoever, just a vaguely defined concept, ""I want to do something from a woman's point of view"". The result is an insult rather than a tribute to a female perspective on life.  To make things worse, there's not an interesting shot to be found in the entire film. I cannot think of a cast who could have spiced this one up, but Johanna ter Steege is a (small) light in the dark, if possible with this dire lack of material. I'm trying to imagine how Leopold tried directing Maria Kraakman: ""Maria, look at the horizon, we'll film you for three minutes, just express sadness"". A perfect cure for insomnia. Get a copy and watch this late at night, guaranteed too put you to sleep.  Camera Obscura --- 1/10"
2,"DW Griffith films are like proverbs. For every one preaching one point of view, you can find another stating the opposite. The Massacre is, perhaps, the ""Too many cooks spoil the broth"" to The Battle of Elderbrush Gulch's ""Many hands make light work"".  Although the framing story is that of a family of white settlers, the central segment showing a seemingly unprovoked raid on an Indian village (an equally viable candidate for the titular massacre) is a different matter. The camera is literally on the side of the Indians, joining them on the hillside as they flee. The cavalry charge is not exciting (and Griffith was more than capable of making it so had he wished), and in both this and the final massacre the mid-shots are mostly of victims being gunned down, whereas the attackers are only shown in distant ""god"" shots.  The Massacre was Griffith's last two-reeler before he moved onto features (which Judith of Bethulia could be counted as), and there are some good examples of how he is now adept at balancing out a longer story. While the opening scenes are fairly inconsequential, there is a single close-up of Blanche Sweet's baby  which not only elicits an emotional response, but also helps us remember the child later on. Later, there is a short scene of some of the settlers playing cards, which seems superfluous at the time, but it pays off towards the end when one of the men is killed, the cards spilling from his hand as he falls. Perhaps most significant of all are the couple of brief family shots from the Indian village shortly before the first massacre, neatly echoing the scenes with the settler family.  Another shot, not as effective but nevertheless remarkable, is of a wolf being frightened off by a bear, just before the Indians attack. It's a rare bit of symbolism from Griffith and while not particularly subtle it was quite a novelty for the time. And it does sum up the message of the picture, the same as that of Fort Apache; that Native Americans, while being traditional antagonists of the Western genre, should never be underestimated."
1,"It's hard to say anything about a movie like this because there isn't enough words to give this magnificent, stylish and unique film the veneration it unquestionably deserves. They should make this the official and only true real Hamlet -movie because all the previous films out of the same immortal spectacle are being overshadowed by Kenneth Branagh's ""Hamlet"".  It's a perfect, complete version of the play, potent, massive, earthshaking first-class masterpiece Shakespeare would have been proud of. They've packed over a dozen of world-famous top actors in the same film and everyone of them is having one of the greatest performances of their career. Every moving and charming sequence leaves behind a comprehensive sense of satisfaction.  The cameras embrace gracefully the enchanting coulisses. Branagh is phenomenal in the leading role. His sharp, irresistible performance is the only one of it's kind and will be permanently part of the glorious movie history. Every second in this presentation is feast for the movie lover from beginning to the very end. Branagh's version of ""Hamlet"" is among the ten best motion pictures ever."
1,"I, like many horror fans, have been force fed the same banal big budget Hollywood remakes and MTV high school slasher tripe for the last 20 years. Here, at last, is an original horror genre movie that ticks all the right boxes.  You want a hot lead actress, you want vampires, you want cool weapons, you want cool vehicles and you want blood, lots of it, by the bucket load - you got it.  With excellent fight choreography and a supporting role from the Hammer Horror scream queen herself Stephanie Beacham, this really is fantastic stuff.  Despite it's low budget, by opting to use 35 mm stock and adding quality CG effects to the mix, director James Eaves has created something that feels much bigger.  A must for old school horror fans."
1,"After CITIZEN KANE in 1941, Hollywood executives turned their cob-webbed backs on the great Orson Welles. With the exception of KANE, Welles lost all creative control on MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS, JOURNEY INTO FEAR, and many other films to come. Welles was an innovative and creative genius, the most unconventional of filmmakers when Hollywood was in need of a few more. THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is yet another example of the misunderstood view of Welles' films at the time, a movie that seems a bit choppy and non-fluent. It has a conventional 1940's premise told in a most unconventional way, and I am sure some scenes ended up on the cutting room floor. It is now legend that Columbia mogul Harry Cohn stood up during its initial screening and asked what it was about. In hindsight, many old grumps that ran the studios back then had not one clue as to the cinematic techniques and master story-telling of Orson Welles and THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is only nearly great because of their intrusion.  Beside being arguably the greatest director of all-time, Welles was also quite a performer as an actor. At 25, we all know what he did as ""Charles Foster Kane"", perhaps the most famous character in film history. Here, he inhabits a rare character of dim wit and not much intelligence, something unfamiliar to those familiar with Welles other great work. Instead of a slick, wise tongue, he speaks with a rough, Irish twang. Rita Hayworth (his unhappily married wife at the time) plays an unhappily married wife of a lawyer who puts Welles in a spell and is able to draw him into a job that will take him to the limits of deception and disillusionment. He is a large lug who may have even murdered a man, but the real mystery lies in the relationship between Hayworth (with stunning blonde hair) and crippled hubby Everett Sloane (Mr. Bernstein from CITIZEN KANE). A creepy partner of Sloane's is along for the sail around the country to set off a number of peculiar events that has Welles' ""Michael O'Hara"" head spinning. Welles narrates the picture as O'Hara, but things are still unclear throughout. See for yourself and realize that it takes at least 2 viewings to fully know exactly what's up.  An uncharacteristically strange courtroom sequence centers around ""O'Hara"", with Sloane defending him. It is an oddly comedic scene with some quirky courtroom methods, including Sloane cross-examining himself. I didn't really laugh here because the film stalls at this point after a first portion that never gets to take off anyway. Up to this point, the cinematography is great, some scenes are shot with craft and skill (aquarium love scene), but there is no distinct line drawing the elements and us, the audience, in. Reportedly, the court scene was re-shot against Welles' requests (10 closeups of Hayworth were ordered) and a makeshift song sung by the starlet was thrown in at Cohn's insistence. A gaudy score infuriated Welles, who once again, was left out of the editing process. Thank Welles himself for saving the film entirely with a tour-de-force ending that will always be treasured. The so-called ""Hall of Mirrors"" scene brings buffs back time and time again, rightfully so.  It must be seen to be believed and it does a good job of wrapping up some confusing ideas presented. The crash of the mirrors represents ""O'Hara's"" disillusionment and the ""crazy house"" itself is a masterpiece of art and set decoration. It seems more like a state of mind than an actual place and is indeed ""crazy"", twisted and turned like a Dali painting. This is a great ending to a flawed picture that if left alone would probably have made the AFI's Top 100. Then again, 3 or 4 more of Orson Welles films may have made all collective ""best of"" lists if he had been left alone to create his own magic.  NOTE: Look for the Mercury Players that are so prominent in Welles pictures. They pop up all over. RATING: 8 of 10"
0,"The plot is so manipulative, counting completely on the most uncredible and unthinkable decisions of the adults in each and every parenting decision. The children are super as far as charm and delivery of the lines but as I say, the whole plot depends on each and every adult being complete idiots, and therefore in THAT case, making more sense out of their actions (and at the same time being the only way to explain the boys actions of total mistrust). Why would sweey charming little boys take a baby from the shore? How did the baby get to the shore and at the same time account for it being the LAST place to be searched? Why would the 2 boys NEVER be informed an instead at the same time a baby is missing nobody gives a fig about them running around with food and diapers with all that commotion going on and literally every other place it searched? There is just no possible justification to ask the audience to believe this. Asking to believe it would then do to trial (even the informal setting) is too insulting to bare."
2,"i cant say a negative word about this film as i would obviously be taken it out of context as it is without drought the sort of film the typifies quality direction acting and great moody dialogue not to mention the original scenes. it has no relation to lock stock,its far more left field than that watch this film its great.also the acting is superb charlot Coleman's last film before she tragically died saw a performance second to none. its a shame films like this arnt being made in the uk anymore, talent is hard to come by and films like this and others of this jonrer, this i mean the ones that have the rare power to create atmosphere and this is one of them."
2,"Much better than i expected. I first saw this film on one of those boring rainy days where you end up sitting in front of the TV channel surfing. i stopped while this was on. needless to say, i watched the whole thing and totally enjoyed it.  it's very funny at times, and the plot is hilarious! some of the comedy is slapstick and some of it isn't...but it's all good. give it a rent and you won't be disappointed. i just picked up the DVD for 9.99 and i'm glad i did.  yeahhhhhhhhhhh yeah yeah!  (sorry, i need ten lines before i could post a comment)"
2,"The Genji and Heike gangs show down in a settlement named Utah, while a cliché stoic gunman comes to the support of what's left of the community, inspired by Sergio Corbucci's spaghetti western Django. I haven't seen Django, and actually I saw much more candid likeness to Kurosawa's Yojimbo and Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars.  The fast-paced action is well staged on a set that sponges both western and samurai ways of life. Miike jumbles both sensationalized gunplay and martial arts swordplay, which interact solidly in anticipation of the climactic fight, by which time we're practically exhausted. What may be the oddest facet of Miike's western, if you'll accept the odd/Miike redundancy, is his choice to apply a Japanese cast to speak English. It's a curious variety that initially feels like a gimmicky innovation, merely to blend into this aimless entertainment's wacky milieu. Nevertheless, it results keeping the characters two-dimensional and the audience aloof. Quentin Tarantino, who plays a bit role, speaks English as usual but with some gawky, cartoonish twang and tone of voice with the talent of an 11-year-old and no sense of cultural origin and no connection at all to the subject matter, obscure though it may be. I really wish he would either never act again, or learn how to portray a real human being and not some B-movie caricature, which no matter what role he's ever played is what he always does. He measures all of life to B-movie caricature.  Miike's typically cynical detachment from his work makes for another one of his zany spectacles, and with stunningly vivid production design. At the end of the day, this dispassionate flourish of style by itself is a very wearing encounter. This is not a film you become absorbed in but instead one that you're expected to watch with a nonchalant, half- sober feeling of sardonic lack of involvement. And some people like to watch movies that way. I don't think Miike has ever made a movie for everyone, even though he's made almost 70 in under 20 years. And for that I admire him."
2,"This film is cute and watchable even today--and that's something you CAN'T say about many of the very early movies--particularly those of George Albert Smith. Most films of the day are of pretty mundane topics or are only about one or two minutes long. This film, in contrast, is longer and actually tries to have Mary Jane try to be a slapstick comedienne. She is a cook and doesn't seem to do anything right. While not great or amazing like the contemporary films of Georges Méliès, this is still pretty good and watchable--particularly the slapstick ending! Plus, films like this eventually led to films like those of the later and much more famous slapstick comedians, so historically it's pretty important."
1,"When I first saw this movie I was with my dad. He encouraged me to watch this movie because it was one of his favorites. After watching the movie it instantly became one of my favorites.   A River Runs Through It is about two brothers who each take a different path in life. Norman Maclean (Craig Sheffer) is the older of the two brothers and he is set on the path of education. Paul Maclean (Brad Pitt) is the rebellious younger brother who travels on a path full of obstacles. The movie follows these characters as the each follow their own path.  There is no downside to this movie. You will be entertained the whole way through. The acting, directing, and script is all perfect. The two things that are exceptional are the cinematography and the score. Both of which entrap you in the world Robert Redford creates for you.   This is an all around great movie that is destined to be a classic. It sure is in my book. If you haven't seen this movie definitely watch it as soon as you can because it will stay with you forever."
2,"Q: What's the difference between a fire-breathing dragon and a mid-summer movie?  A: One is a lumbering monster with a tiny brain that rains death and destruction, and the other is just a big lizard.  ""Reign of Fire"" is basically ""Waterworld"" with gasoline, with all that that entails. The story begins in London in 2008, when a tunnel crew unearths a massive underground chamber containing a dragon who, like most of us, is a little cranky first thing in the morning. The dragon, oddly, sleeps through the breaching of its den with a massive roaring drilling machine, and only wakes up when it is nudged. All of a sudden dragons are greeting the dawn all over the world and torching things with more reckless abandon than the U.S. Forest Service. The world is shortly destroyed, as we learn in a drawn-out opening sequence involving an unseen narrator writing in a journal, though he doesn't seem to be writing what he's saying. Most of the story takes place in 2020, where a society of refugees led by Quinn (Christian Bale) lives in a decrepit English castle, hiding from the dragons.  Things can only get so bad in Europe, of course, before the Americans show up, and show up they do, in an armored column of the Kentucky Irregulars, led by tattooed, bald nut case Denton Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey). He has a crazy idea that entails killing the boss dragon, since it is the only male dragon of the millions around the globe (must be a busy fella).  It's critical in post-apocalypse movies to establish a credible and vivid world, with a balance of the modern and the primitive, and a sense of how societal priorities have changed to suit the new reality. The classic case was the jury-rigged ingenuity of the ""Mad Max"" movies, where V8 engines were prized and gasoline more precious than life. They weren't necessarily realistic, but they were believable, because they established a set of rules and stuck by them. ""Reign of Fire"" is all out of whack in this department: the castle-dwellers are on the brink of starvation, but seem to have a limitless supply of electricity, without even a cursory explanation of where it comes from. As part of their security net, they use massive searchlights to monitor the night skies. Uh, way to keep a low profile, guys. Van Zan's people, on the other hand, apparently have an endless supply of fuel, enough to maintain a gas-guzzling tank and a helicopter(!) with again, no hint of how. Not to mention the fact that the world was supposedly nuked to get rid of the dragons, yet the word ""radiation"" never so much as passes anyone's lips. Plus, the movie can't even keep track of its own timeline.  All this could have been forgiven if we got some gut-wrenching army n' dragon smackdowns. Van Zan is supposed to be a fearsome dragon killer, so you would figure that he and his militia would have some savvy anti-dragon tactics figured out, from the painful lessons learned by the doomed struggle of the world's armies, but no. When they take on a dragon in the castle environs, their plan of attack is so suicidally ludicrous it would take a minor miracle to work just once. Without going into too much detail, it involves ground-based radar monitors, a high-tech computer tracking system, and skydivers, all to try and bring the beast to earth so McConaughey can kill it with an axe. Seriously.  The movie has its good points, though: it is capably directed by TV veteran Rob Bowman, who at least manages to imbue the ridiculous proceedings with some sort of dramatic tension. The climactic battle is pretty impressive, and there is an awesome scene of the dragon hovering over the militia while lines of tracers whip through the night sky and the smoke roils under his wings. Wolf Kroeger's production design isn't bad, the landscape is suitably scorched and desperate, though it looks like they might have swiped some sets from ""Enemy at the Gates"". The dragons themselves, of course, are amazing. They are truly mean hombres of fluid reptilian grace, whose jaws leak flaming liquid as they breathe. They (almost) convince you that they really could have destroyed the world, that they wouldn't have been swatted from the sky in two seconds by any F-18 pilot with half a brain and a rack of heat-seekers. But then you expect great effects from even the most dim-witted of movies these days.  Like most monster movies, ""Reign of Fire"" suffers badly when the monsters are offscreen catching a smoke break, and we are left with flat characters speaking silly dialogue in a tepid story. Bale is all right, though his character comes off as something of a weenie. McConaughey, meanwhile, has no chemistry with anyone or anything on screen. He's a buffed-out paramilitary psycho, but not an interesting one. You can't figure out how he became the leader (maybe he was the only one who could drive a tank). The most engaging character is Alex, the helicopter pilot, played by Izabella Scorupco (the luminous computer expert in ""GoldenEye""), who isn't given much attention by the script, but who seems like she would have been a better choice to lead the militia. Too bad she wasn't the main character.  But the humans aren't the real stars anyway. I sort of picture a dragon, guzzling an Evian bottle of lighter fluid, and barking into his cell phone:  ""I'm telling you, Marty, I've had it! C'mon, I can fly! I can breathe fire! That idiot T-Rex gets a three-picture deal with Spielberg, and what do I get? First ""Dungeons & Dragons"" and now THIS! Whaddaya doing to me? Get me a meeting with Katzenberg, or I torch Burbank."""
2,"I first read the novels ""I, Claudius"" and ""Claudius the God"" when I was a sophomore in college. I instantly fell in love with them and it sparked my interest in Roman history. Naturally, I jumped at the chance to watch this mini series based on the books shortly thereafter. Eventually, I decided to buy it, and it still remains one of my favorite DVD box sets.  In the mini series there are some minor anachronisms and some events are out of sequence, but it still captures the political intrigue of the imperial family in ancient Rome. I'm not going to go into the story more than this because it gets very complicated and it is very long.  What really made this series stick out was the cast. Sir Derek Jacobi leads the cast as Claudius. Most of the story is told through his eyes as he writes a history of his experiences with the imperial family and some incidents that happened prior to Claudius' birth. Some other cast members include Brian Blessed as Augustus, Sian Phillips as Livia (Augustus' wife, and Claudius' grandmother), George Baker as Tiberius, John Hurt as Caligula, and Patrick Stewart as Sejanus to name a few. Fans of British cinema will be able to pick out even more familiar faces (I can't really go into all of the cast because there are so many excellent actors and actresses in this).  What really makes the story work is the interplay between the characters and the almost constant intrigue that goes on around the Roman political scene. The best part of it is that what happens is for the most part true or at least based on the writings of historians of the time. I recommend this highly to anyone who is interested in learning about Roman history and wants to get their feet wet.  On a somewhat amusing side note, Patrick Stewart (with hair) makes out with Magenta from ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show."""
2,"Irwin Allen produced a pair of memorable disaster epics in the early '70s, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and ""The Towering Inferno"". However, Allen hit rock bottom with his final theatrical film ""When Time Ran Out..."". This movie is not up there in the same league as those two blockbusters. In fact, this is an embarrassment to all involved. The great cast that's featured here (Paul Newman, William Holden, Jacqueline Bisset, Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons, etc.) deserved a good movie here. Instead, they're in a movie that features inept acting, inept dialogue, and especially inept special effects. See ""Dante's Peak"" or ""Volcano"" instead.  * (out of four)"
2,"If you judged every director on only the one title, then your DVD shelf would be a very lonely place. Coppola, Spielberg, Stone, hell even Scorsese - they have all made slight 'miscalculations' throughout their respective careers. Keeping that in mind though, the last film that I saw from Gary Graver was the abysmal 'slasher' Trick or Treats, which in all honesty made Plan 9 from Outer Space look intellectual. Taking that into account I must admit that I didn't expect much from Moon in Scorpio. But with notorious exploitation titan Fred Olen Ray on board as co-producer, there's no way of ever knowing exactly what to expect. In all honesty the bizarre casting decision of putting Britt Eckland's name above the title was more than enough to get my initial curiosities aroused.  Keeping things hackneyed, we begin with the oldest of all slasher clichés. Yep you guessed it; an unseen nut-nut makes a break from the least secure mental hospital imaginable, killing an unfortunate orderly on the way. Once outside the complex, the psycho makes short work of a cheery pharmaceutical salesman and then flees the scene in the dead guy's car. For some inexplicable reason, the head psychiatrist doesn't bother informing the Police that they have a murderous maniac on the loose. Instead he calls in Private Detective Richard Vargas who is described by one shrink as being, ""Almost crazy enough to be a patient here himself."" Next we fast-forward two weeks and Vargas is seen boarding an abandoned-looking boat that is adrift in the middle of the sea. Once on board he finds Linda (Britt Eckland) sprawled across the floor in a heap. Whilst attempting to wake her up, she stabs him in the stomach with a bizarre spear like device. The (unconvincingly) hysterical Linda is then dragged off of the boat by two orderlies who don't seem at all concerned by the fact that Vargas has just been fatally impaled on the huge spike.  A few days later, Linda is fit to be interviewed by the head psychiatrist and he asks her what exactly happened out in the middle of the sea. We soon learn that she had been on a honeymoon with her husband, two of his war buddies and their girlfriends. The plan was to sail too Acapulco and spend a couple of weeks lapping up the sun on the beaches. Unfortunately along with the suitcases and sangria, the gang had inadvertently brought along a maniacal killer who had his own reasons to want to be stranded in the ocean with the holidaymakers. For the rest of the runtime, we see through flashbacks exactly what happened aboard the cursed death ship. Just who was responsible for these viscous murders?   According to many reports that I've read over the web, Moon in Scorpio was continually re-edited by the distributors and was eventually released without any of the supernatural elements that had been originally intended from the script. The IMDb mentions a vampire and astrological plot points, which sounds intriguing, but couldn't be further from the contents of the version that was eventually released direct to video. The only available VHS print is typical slasher by the numbers fare, and contains no trace of the rumored paranormal ingredients. Perhaps one day a Director's Cut DVD will solve the riddle of the missing plot points. Unfortunately whether you can blame the edit-happy distributors or not, Scorpio is a lackadaisical entry that lacks suspense, creativity and effort from any of the big name cast members. Eckland was laughable as she struggled to look even slightly motivated, whilst hard man character actor William Smith was totally wasted in an undemanding role.  The film's structure is also totally inept. The flashback narration seems to run illogically beside what we are seeing on the screen and we are never given a credible conclusion as to the killer's motives. At a guess, I'd say that the maniac became a vampire post-death in the scenes that ended up on the cutting room floor. At one point in the runtime there's a slight hint as a character drinks her partner's blood after he accidentally cuts his finger whilst dicing carrots. There's also a sub-plot involving a link between the three male cast members, who fought in Vietnam together. But these few scenes, which amusingly look more like they were filmed in a park down the road from Gary Graver's house than anywhere near 'Nam, never amount to anything either. If you don't manage to work out the unseen killer's identity by the half hour mark then you shouldn't be watching anything that's not PG-13 rated. And the anemic showdown between the survivor and the killer couldn't have been any less entertaining if it were filmed in slow motion.  Perhaps one day we will be able to see what Graver really intended with Moon in Scorpio. But as it stands I'm afraid that there is very little to recommend. Don't bother hunting this one down."
2,"It's amazing how the BHC franchise is seen as something of an emergency button marked ""career resuscitate"". Sure, there was an obvious sense of inevitability about a first sequel, and it pretty much followed straight afterwards, just restoring Murphy's stock after one less than stellar box office feature (The Golden Child).  After that there'd been the classic Murphy of Coming To America, another huge hit, followed by a string of adequate - and probably better than their reputation - movies in Harlem Nights, Another 48 Hrs. and Boomerang. This then saw Murphy's stock drop again with the underrated but underachieving The Distinguished Gentleman... which is where Beverley Hills Cop III comes in.  Though two or three years in the planning, it was the one designed to bring him back. Deservedly it was his biggest flop to that date, as it was, perhaps non coincidentally, also his worst movie at that point. A fat, bloated string of nonsensical set pieces that sees such indulgent turns as acting roles for all of Landis's director friends, it lurches from one meaningless sequence to the next. The behind the scenes documentary alledges that the writer didn't even know what the criminals would be using an amusement park for until very near the end of the project's genesis. That pretty much says it all... what WOULD a criminal gang be using a Disney-style amusement park for? The fact that the film was location first, plot second points at everything that's wrong with Beverley Hills Cop III.  It's surprising that the movie misfires as much as it does, considering that Landis was behind two of Murphy's best pictures - Trading Places and the aforementioned Coming To America. That said, the absence of previous stars - Hector Elizondo stuck playing an obvious John Ashton clone in Ashton's scheduling absence - does hurt the picture, along with Murphy's phoned-in performance. That said, the move away from comedy and into action also doesn't help, Murphy getting his final ""huh huh huh huh"" after seeing himself and his friends shot and bleeding to death. Yet to compensate for the lack of a Ronny Cox or a Paul Reiser, they bring back Serge from the first film. While it's always amusing to see Bronson Pinchot attempting to make Eddie Murphy corpse on camera, the fact that a homosexual coffee house owner has now become an arms dealer shows how events frequently serve the plot rather than any form of logistical sense.  All this said, Beverley Hills Cop III isn't a BAD film as such, and it's always watchable, if not terribly good. All of the edge that was there previously has gone, and the ludicrousness of the situations fail to engage the viewer. After this it was a flop vampire movie (made for less than Murphy's entire fee for Beverley Hills Cop III) before Nutty Professor was the one to bring him back. After that, Murphy went into a spate of successful child movies and a series of decreasing returns playing multiple characters using fat suits, culminating in reputedly his biggest-ever flop, Meet Dave. Cue Beverley Hills Cop IV...."
2,"Where to begin ? Anak (or 'The Child' as it is known in the West) is an absolutely amazing movie, a movie so powerful that it deserves to be watched by everyone. The Story is set around Josie and her family, Many years ago - Josie had to leave her family and become a domestic over-seas so she that she could provide money to support her family, when Josies husband dies, Josie returns to her family to take over her job as mother, but when she returns, her family is anything but loving and welcoming.  The acting in this movie is magnificent, I had never heard of Vilma Santos until I watched Anak, however after seeing it I had to rent out some of her other movies, the emotion shown by Vilma, and the other actors is amazing and at times you really can find yourself believing that this family is real. There were times in the movie I laughed, times I cried, but I loved every second of it, and it blows almost every Hollywood movie out of the water.  Anak just goes to show that a movie dosn't need to have sex, drugs & violence, and also not be a Children's movie to be excellent and a must-see for the entire family  10/10"
2,"Not quite slapstick but nearly entertaining, Ninja Bachelor Party is your best last resort for a dying party or boring summer afternoon. The plot meanders, the mostly intelligible voice-overs are funny, and the almost steady camera work will make you wish you had Dramamine®. A must see that will leave you scratching your head as to just exacly WHY it's a must see."
2,"A lost pistol, one police officers search through the sleazy side of post war Tokyo to track it down and save his honour by doing so - a classic film noir plot. This is a Kurosawa movie, so of course it is executed brilliantly. This film is full of dazzling sequences with highly imaginative and technically adept editing and camera work. This may be his first 'great' movie, but in some sections it betrays his relative inexperience as a film maker - it slightly loses focus in the central part of the movie and he occasionally over-eggs his metaphors (something Kurosawa was always inclined to do). He is also clearly experimenting with different techniques, he hasn't quite found his own unique film language. But it is still a truly great film, it deserves to rank up there with the best noir movies from America and France.  There are many pleasures here - the vivid scenes set in a crippled and poverty stricken Tokyo - the individual vignettes - the pain of the widower who curls up in agony at the thought of his dead wife - the young dancer torn in her loyalties to the one man who showed her generosity - and even the twisted agony of the murderer as he realizes he has lost his freedom. The penultimate chase sequence is truly masterful, its hard to imagine it being ever done better - every element of it, the chase, the cutting to a piano playing lady, curious at the noise, the final vision of children playing and a flower blowing in the wind - stunning.  Most of all, this is a morally complex movie - the constant unease of the policeman who realizes how close he is to the 'stray dog' nags away at the movie and becomes stunningly real at the end, as they both lay exhausted in the grass side by side, almost like sated lovers. Kurosawa was far ahead of his time in his portrayal of how chance determines how we end up, but having fallen on one side of good or evil, people build up walls to emphasize their separation from the 'other'. As a new policeman, Mifune is tortured by his knowledge of how similar he is to the killer, but his older, more mature colleague assures him that he will learn to hate them, to see them as beneath him.  As with most of Kurosawas movies, there are no simple conclusions - while there may be superficial 'morals' to his tales, look beneath and there are layers upon layers of complexity and ambiguity, but always within a context of his sympathetic humanism. His films may be bleak but they never give in to cynicism or irony.  This may not be quite as accomplished as his later 'High and Low', but it is still a terrific thriller that puts the vast majority of modern movies to shame. Strongly recommended."
2,"Not long after the new animated series of Batman started they made a movie. Batman is suspected of murdering a gangster after a mysterious dark man does it. The police are now on the lookout for Batman (Kevin Conroy). Bruce Wayne (Batman's real name) meanwhile is having flashback's of a previous love, Andrea 'Andi' (Dana Delany) that he misses. When he finds her she obviously finds out he's Batman and they get back together. Unfortunately, he also finds out that she is this mysterious dark man, The Phantasm. Also, The Joker (Star Wars' Mark Hamill) is trying to find 'Andi' to kill her before he is next. A good animated film with some good action, and it almost warmed up towards the TV series. Batman was number 84 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!"
1,"Strangely, this version of OPEN YOUR EYES is more mature and more nuanced. Aided by hindsight, Crowe's screenplay is a lot tighter and more fleshed out than Amenabar's original. The Spanish filmmaker should get credit for thinking of the story first, but there's no doubt that Crowe has improved on it -- if just slightly. Notice that you have no idea what the lead did in OPEN YOUR EYES, but you know almost everything about the lead in VANILLA SKY. That's what i mean by more ""fleshed out."""
2,"Started out to seem like one of those exploitation fliks lots of naked ladies, dodgy doctors, even dodgier prison warders, yes this is what happens in the first half hour or so, but actually it turns out to have a fairly good ,if not basic, story line. No surprises,obvious out-come, but ok acting bearing in mind it must have been made for about £250. Goes on to have a moral deciding theme, do you go by the rules or do you break them? Give this film a go, if you are male you will probably love it, if you are female....I'm not so sure."
1,"I rented this film in DVD form without knowing anything at all about it, part of a winter marathon of watching a film every night. After several awful American action adventure films (Ballistic, Daredevil, Cradle of Life) Zhu Warriors struck me as brilliantly original filmmaking. The story is complete nonsense, but I found the film's sincerity, good- heartedness and complete lack of irony refreshing, and the film looks spectacular. Sure, the special effects are not technically as flawless as those produced by Hollywood, but the filmmakers wisely are more interested in color, composition and movement than realism and so many of the shots are breathtaking. In one shot, two of the superhuman characters stand on craggy spires of rock, a huge moon rising before them, the image perfectly balanced by the three elements. In another, a princess-warrior spires through the heavens behind her glowing sword like a heat-seeking missile. And the colors explode from shot to shot, used to express emotion rather than to represent reality.  The characters have the same simplicity and directness of comic book characters, offering no great depth in themselves but referring to archtypes that resonate more deeply. Physically, several of the actors are astonishingly beautiful. They play their roles straight up, without irony or guile, and so are believable.  Most strange of all, despite the clumsiness of plot and thin characterizations, I found myself very near tears at the end, moved by the beautiful simplicity of the actors and the wildly original, good-hearted vision of the director.  "
2,"this movie is a waste of time. the script has gaps the scenes are not continues, the special effects are childish and in some scenes you can see that there is a stunt man instead of the actor, a lot of childish shooting and nothing else.....even at the closing scene where the bomb explodes in the sea the effect of making the sea is ridiculous...... This movie should get negative votes.....what a pity... There is nothing good to write except maybe for the eyes of the co-star female actor....Even though at the beginning shows promising the rest is for the garbage... I also wonder why for the 2/3 of the movie G. Seagal wears the same dirty clothes? thumps down and straight to the garbage can....."
2,"I was quite surprised to see that the writer/director of The Lookout has quite an established career as a Hollywood writer, since this film offers nothing new (then again, maybe that's a key to longevity in Hollywood). I was also surprised to see the gushing reviews that this rather cliché film garnered from some major critics. It is character-driven story. The only problem is, none of the characters are particularly interesting. The story revolves around a young man as he struggles with a post-car accident brain injury. Unfortunately, those struggles are only superficially touched upon. We see him in some sort of rehabilitation school for about a minute, then a brief meeting with a therapist, (assuming she will be a major character in the piece), who is never seen or heard from again. His relationship with his wealthy family could have been interesting, however, we only see them in the briefest of scenes, and are not even sure who his father is until the final line of that scene when he calls a man ""dad"". The relationship with his blind roommate is not particularly drawn out either (you're half-way through the film before you realize it's his roommate, and not a relative). The other problem is the casting. This is the 2nd film where I've seen Gordon-Levitt try and carry a leading role, and it simply does not go over well. First, he is miscast as a former high-school star hockey player that every guy looked up to and every girl wanted to bed. I've seen many former high school glory boys, and none of them were as diminutive as Gordon- Levitt. But that's a minor problem. What's worse is that, though technically a sound actor, Levitt is part of a whole crop of up-and-coming former child actors that seem completely untouched by life (see Josh Hartnett). There's no real presence or weight there. It's as if, after years of these young men and women being scolded not to overact and ""be natural"", that now they do nothing at all, besides ""mood act"", which is an instant cure for insomnia. This young man is being hailed as ""one to watch"", so maybe there's something I'm missing here. But I will say that it's getter harder to."
2,"I got my screener copy of this movie over the weekend and couldn't wait to check it out. You see, I was pointed in the direction of this movie a couple years ago, while the filming was still going on.  The movie tells the story of Zack (Wicks), a billiard store owner torn between his love for his ex-girlfriend, Jen (Stanzione), and the temptations of bachelorhood.  To be completely honest, I wasn't sure what to expect. It looked like it had some potential, but I was worried about the story and quite frankly, with indie films, you can weed through a lot of junk to get a few gems.  I'm not going to give this a sizzling review, but I did like it a lot. If you like Kevin Smith movies, I think you'll get a kick out of this film. I honestly hadn't paid any attention to the fact that the film makers were influenced so much by Kevin Smith (Dogma, Clerks, Chasing Amy) but it wasn't far into the movie that I noticed a few subtle (and a couple very clear) Kevin Smith film references.  In fact, according to the site, Kevin Smith gives it his seal of approval: ""Kisses and Caroms is as assured a first film as I've ever seen. Crackling with strong performances, this sexy little day-in-the-lifer is worth your time."" - Kevin Smith, Director Clerks, Dogma  K&C feels a lot like Clerks, but is still fresh enough to enjoy. I expected less than I got in regards to overall quality and story. Unlike Star Wars Episode I, which didn't live up at all to my expectations, Kisses & Caroms was a pleasant surprise. I'm definitely going to be watching out for more Vince Rocca films, just as I kept the name Kevin Smith in my head after seeing Clerks."
2,"I found this movie to be one of the most inspirational that I have seen in a long time. The filming was exceptional. The riding that Viggo Mortensen did was awesome and the horse that was Hidalgo was quite an actor. I was riveted throughout and it should be considered an epic. This movie shows so much about this particular piece of our past and how we started and what happened to the Native American Indians and to the Mustangs. We don't have enough of this kind of movie now. There are children that don't know about these things. There were many messages in this movie that were courageously and sensitively put forth. Viggo Mortensen was perfect in every way as was the horse. I found all of the actors wonderful, the scenery so different from just a western and the horsemanship outstanding. What a movie. I loved it. I will see it again, in the movie theater, and I will buy it when available."
2,"Very plainly and very simply this movie is BRILLIANT!!! THis movie is not a comedy. IT is a love story, a true love story in disguise. The college dorm room setting... disguise. The maker, National Lampoon, a disguise. Here is the equation. Life is about love and life is also about pain. This movie is about both of them. This movie illustrates the feelings of love and the pain that goes along with it that we experience in life. The viewer must watch this movie for what it is... not for what it is not. The viewer must watch this movie with an open mind and not expect a comedy. This movie is much, much more than that. This movie couldn't be more about real life if it tried."
2,"For what it is, a silly 2 1/2 minute skit starring Adam Sandler, I thought this was great. The opening shot is particually PT Anderson, but the rest is just down right stupid humour. The ending particually cracked me up, although I honestly don't get what the hell happened (and I don't think I'm supposed to). This is simply just PTA and Sandler screwing around with a free set after filming PDL, so I doubt any real thought went into this, so please don't expect ""Magnolia"" or ""Boogie Nights"" or anything, just expect a stupid, retard Sandler style short that will leave you confussed, laughing, and saying out loud ""What the F***?""."
2,"This movie is absolutely incredible. It essentially includes every crap and cliché about ""badass Americans"" (Go! Go! Go! Shoot! U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!) Approximately 1/3 of the movie takes part in pubs in meaningless macho pilots discussions ""who had bigger balls"", ""who has bigger balls"" or ""who will have bigger balls"" (including pretty blonde - which is actually pretty intelligent - and she is general's daughter too - and she is amazing female Apache pilot - of course with some stress syndrome which makes her somehow less usable than real U-S-A macho pilot). Approximately 1/3 of movie scenes do have BIG U-S-A FLAGS in background with big U-S-A talks in foreground (""terorists"" making fun from ""flag-wavers"", letters of dead soldiers pathetically read by officer and such patriotic-anger inducing crap). The last 1/3 of the movie consists of explosions and poorly animated Apache sequences. It is very strange for such hyper patriotic movie but it seems to be pretty anti-patriotic sometimes as officers do smoke Havana cigars (isn't it still illegal in US?). The pilots seem to be pretty inept too, because multiple Apaches are shot down with RPG-7 which is actually anti tank-short range weapon. It is pretty hard to hit helicopter with something like this, essentially the target must not maneuver at all and shooter must be very good too. These ""U-S-A"" ace pilots do fly like sitting ducks and are constantly shot down with bunch of guys with wool hats, AK-47s and RPGs. Let's hope these terrorists never get hands over actual anti air weapons, or the ""U-S-A"" is doomed I think... Well this movie seems to be parody of itself. I think it was written by some anti-American leftist propaganda intellectual, as it is really poor, stupid and technically complete inept. No, I do believe no American is actually so stupid and inept as these ""U-S-A heroes"". I do hope that filmmakers have been used as practice targets because this is really an incredibly huge insult to Apache pilots."
2,"This almost eighty-year old film will bring both a tear and a smile. It is the story of washed-up and somewhat alcoholic boxer Andy Purcell (Wallace Beery), just known as ""Champ"" to everyone, including his adoring little son, ""Dink"", played by Jackie Cooper. It's as though life has really ceased to have meaning for the Champ ever since he lost his championship status. The only thing that continues to give his life meaning is his son. The Champ isn't exactly providing a wholesome environment for Dink. Dink hangs out in pool halls with his Dad, isn't enrolled in school, and sits up nights alone in their dingy room waiting for the Champ to come home when he is out on a drinking binge. Champ's ex-wife, socialite Linda, sees Andy and Dink at the racetrack one day and tries to convince Andy that Dink would be better off with her. At first the Champ is unpersuaded. However, when he gets a hold of a good sum of money and gambles it away and winds up in the drunk tank overnight he decides that maybe it is for the best if Dink goes with Linda.  Wallace Beery had some lean times after motion pictures transitioned to sound, however he got a new lease on his career at MGM, and it turned out that his coarse voice attracted fans rather than repelled them. He won a well-deserved Best Actor award for his role, but if there had been a Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 1931 it would have gone to nine-year old Jackie Cooper. He is comic as the street-wise kid meeting his half-sister for the first time - ""The dame is goofy"" he remarks. He is heart-rending when the Champ tells him he doesn't want him around any more, that he's tired of feeding him, just so he'll go with his mother.  A minor point that made this film so refreshing for me is that nobody tries to ""lawyer up"" or turn Dink's fate into a courtroom battle. Everyone deals with everyone else in this film on decent human terms. In the end the Champ tries to regain the championship so he can provide a good life for his son and so that his son can respect him, not so that he can win a custody fight."
2,"****MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**** This movie was great. I never get tired of seeing it. I really like Quentin's character. He stole every scene he was in. I kind of wish they had made a spin off with his character because he was really interesting. I would have liked to have seen the relationship he had with his father because from the way him and Harper talked it seemed his father was always on him about choosing a career and the last thing he needed was for Harper to be doing that to him. Like he didn't need another father figure who didn't approve of his lifestyle. With the way the movie ended I think it would have been good to develop a story between him and Shelby. See where that would go. Also show him in his playing ways and also show him playing the guitar a lot more like he was working on putting together a record, the way he played was tight. But if they were to make a movie on just his character only Terrence Howard could play him and only Malcolm Lee would be able to pull off a great job directing it."
2,"MY COUSIN VINNY is just one of those ""feel good"" movies delivering some grins that won't wash away. An excellent cast includes Joe Pesci in one of his best roles as a hotshot lawyer. Expect a few unbelievable surprises from the irresistible guy who's smart enough to make one hilarious movie after another. He is downright likeable, and so is Marisa Tomei, a sassy and stylish figurine who was amazingly superb to take home the Best Actress Oscar. Both Pesci and Tomei have the colorful wits and personalities to make a wild pair for themselves (almost like living in the 50s for sure!). Also, the movie's best moment arises when a freight train disturbs Pesci's sleep at five in the morning. The deep downside is the latter portion: a climatic courtroom scene that, while up to the point of interest, runs terribly long and weak....until one of the film's cast members gets into the act! Still, it's worth plenty of good gags and good laughs that aren't so bugging. Pesci would look terrific in a torn-up leather jacket in front of the judge, to his ultimate disgrace! Smart comedy is smart thinking after all."
2,"If you take the toys we loved from the 80's and animate them in short, stop-action pop-culture parodies of everything from Kill Bill to American Idol, throw in voices like Mark Hamill, Phyllis Diller, Christian Slater, Hulk Hogan, Ashton Kutcher, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Seth MacFarlane, and music by Les Claypool, how could it possibly go wrong? Adult Swim's Robot Chicken will show you how. They've secretly replaced the humor with a barrage of bowel movements, flatulence, and more bowel movements. Let's see if you can spot the difference. Apparently there are some who can't. There's nothing wrong with crude humor (as this show claims to have) but Seth Green and Co. just add an extra helping of 'crude' to cover up the fact that there's little to no humor. One scene opens with Skeletor, Mumm-Ra, Cobra Commander, and Lex Luthor sitting in a car together, stuck in traffic. In this scenario, anything that happened would be hilarious. Anything EXCEPT Skeletor farting and forcing the other villains to smell it. Brilliant, right? Right? So if you love super heroes but have always wanted to see them sitting on the toilet, then Robot Chicken is for you. Otherwise, stick with the Simpsons for pop-culture parodies that are actually funny. Maybe Seth Green should stick to doing voices and just play with his toys on the toilet at home to his heart's content. And possibly think about some therapy. Can anyone really be this obsessed with going to the bathroom?."
2,"This film had a lot going for it: it has good pacing, it looks great, Mary Pickford looks great half the time, and it was superficially a perfect vehicle for her. She plays dual roles in this adaptation of William Locke's novel--both the crippled, rich and beautiful Stella Maris and the abused, ugly orphan Unity Blake--the two central characters. Both are in love with the same man (Conway Tearle). The double exposure effects for when Pickford meets Pickford on screen are seamless. Another technical novelty in the film is its final shot, which was probably a crane shot, as zoom-outs weren't in use at the time, as far as I know. Additionally, art director Wilfred Buckland, a notable pioneer in the field, highlights the contrasts between Stella and Unity with the polar surroundings and designs they inhabit.  Here, Pickford demonstrates her versatility, and her double turn is certainly a highlight of her career. The problems with 'Stella Maris' are in its story--the heart of the movie, if one doesn't consider it merely an opportunity to photograph Pickford in different lightings. There are minor faults, such as the goofy dog analogy, but I can overlook them. And, the film begins rather well as a typical melodrama with a double tragedy. Unity's misfortunes are obvious; she is ugly and poor and is beaten severely by the cruel, alcoholic wife of the ideal man both Unity and Stella adore. Stella's life also turns out to be a tragedy in the making; she eventually discovers that those she loves have created a world of illusion for her and that reality is not a fairytale. A happy ending in itself with only one tragedy resulting is not necessarily a problem, either, but it is here.  The film concludes with an intertitle stating ""all's right with the world,"" never mind that Unity has committed a pointless murder and suicide for Stella and the supposed prince, who apparently has never heard of the concept of a divorce, to live happily ever after. And, why does Unity murder his wife? The wife only told the truth to Stella, only met her once, which was because Stella came to her. It's a completely senseless tragedy. Furthermore, starving families still exist (although Stella's mother does well to encourage ignoring that), wars continue and isolated tragedies like Unity's go unabated, yet the intertitle states ""all's right with the world."" It turns out, that Stella has only moved from one fairytale to another--she is still oblivious, and the film itself, it seems, is a fairytale just as bogus as the one Stella was originally led to believe.  This is very disappointing work for Frances Marion, who is one of the first important screenwriters in film history. She managed to become, really, the author of Pickford's films; she even directed one of them ('The Love Light' (1921)). In the end, 'Stella Maris' is a poorly conceived, contrived, self-contradictory mess with screwy morals; it is a lurid soap opera."
0,"It must have been excruciating to attend the dailies as the shooting continued on this failure of a film. Probably Cruise, the Exec. Prod., saw what was happening and had Towne use much, much more of the nude footage in the final cut then Towne wanted to, to make up for the disaster he saw looming.(Maybe Cruise even thought of ""Titanic"".)A few items: Colin Farrell can't act his way out of a paper bag. But he's one of the flavors-of-the-decade, a producer's darling and one is forced to avoid the embarrassment of watching him by not attending his films. He has so many moments of not believing in what he's doing and you can see it in his eyes. I think he would have been at his best as a film actor, albeit not as rich or famous as he is now, playing second banana to dynamic leads who can act. The trap of spending a lot of money for period sets, costumes, cars, et al and photographing them as if they just came from the dry cleaner or car wash/wax. No one seems to want anything to look, well, worn. Or dirty. Is this because the production designer was told by the line producer to make sure they didn't ruin the stuff because then the company wouldhave to pay for the ruined items?  This was a story about the depression-thirties folks, not a Disney Broadway musical about that era. How about doing it in black and white or better yet, given Caleb Deschanel as your D.P., have him desaturate the colors during the mix to suggest some of the actual grime and poorness of the times. It should have been, after all, a bit depressing to live so desperately as these folks did, in the Depression. More on Farrell. Did anyone for a moment believe this guy was a writer? H.L. Mencken on the wall; did I see his eyes roll at one point? Hayek and Farrell as a sexually dynamic duo? Sending a boy to do a man's work? Perhaps in the book, which I haven't read, the story was about an older woman and a youth. I cannot delve too deeply into the middle to latter parts of the film because I bailed out early on. But the memory of the scenes I did see made me think that someone was doing a not-too-amusing parody of a noir movie. Sort of what Saturday Night Live has been like for the past decade: not funny. (In my mind I kept thinking of a Guy Noir sketch, music and all.)"
1,"Such a joyous world has been created for us in Pixar's A Bug's Life; we're immersed in a universe which could only be documented this enjoyably on film, but more precisely a universe which could only be documented through the world of animation. For those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer  when it's in the right hands that is  A Bug's Life is a warm reminder. We walk out of the film with an equally-warm feeling, and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only high-calibre film productions.  It is only Pixar's second animated feature. The sub-group of Disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in 1995, with their landmark movie Toy Story. It was a movie which defied convention, re-invented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence. Now, they return with their sophomore effort which, to be honest, draws a creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the film.  After all, it's a film about ants. Well, all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in A Bug's Life, but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film, as humans are the focal point in dramas, romances and so on. How can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie, let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film? Surely they jest. However, we forget that in Toy Story, a bunch of toy-box items were able to become the grandest, most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted. The guys at Pixar manage to pull off the same feat, and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin you'll probably ever encounter.  Not only are they all entirely amiable and likable  there isn't an unpleasant character in sight; even the villains are riveting characters  but they're colourful, they're eclectic, and they're idiosyncratic. And the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term, only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto A Bug's Life from the beginning. We shall start with our main character, and our hero. His name is Flik (David Foley), and his character is rather generic to say the least. Out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush, beautiful Ant Island, he is the one considered the 'black sheep' of the clan, as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the season's harvest with his antics.  The problem arises in the fact that the ants' harvest is for a bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by Hopper (Kevin Spacey), who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants; when they show up to Ant Island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone, they go insane, for lack of a better term. Hopper offers a proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his pack's hands; however, it's a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil. The cogs and clockwork in Flik's mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame, and he offers to leave Ant Island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colony's rescue and fight off Hopper and the grasshoppers.  If you think about it, A Bug's Life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot line's of Akira Kurosawa's classic Seven Samurai, or the American remake The Magnificent Seven, in which a village of hapless but good-hearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies  one lone village-dweller goes in search for help in the big city, finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil. In A Bug's Life, the help comes in the form of a down-and-out circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by Flik as warriors in a bar-room brawl.  Much amusement comes out of these scenes, and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs. Among them are an erudite stick insect (David Hyde Pierce), a side-splitting obese German caterpillar by the name of Heimlich and a quasi-femme fatale ladybug who's in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug (Dennis Hopper). It's exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs on-screen, as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact on-screen, as is the entire movie collectively.  As I've said, much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another, which give way to a bevy of hilarious lines, wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall a dazzling movie. What makes A Bug's Life even better is that the film isn't restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be, although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film  the clichéd kid-friendly situations are a bit more abundant than we'd like. However, it's easy to ignore this fault, and it's incredulously easy to enjoy this film.  Although A Bug's Life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor, this is still a superb movie, and the start of something promising here. Pixar have proved that they're not just a one-hit wonder, but instead a much-gifted and talented group of film artists in Hollywood. They raise the bar endlessly, and when someone always manages to top their standards, it's only always by themselves. What more is there to say about A Bug's Life other than: see it; it's not quite the best which we've seen from the folks at Emeryville, California, but this beats out the lot of its year  and I'll be damned if this isn't the best animated feature of 1998.  8.5/10"
2,"What can I say? This is a wonderful, gentle film, the kind, sadly, Hollywood no longer makes. I saw it first twenty years ago, and it haunted me ever since; I try to watch it once every couple of years. Fontaine and Cotten are in top form here, as are all the supporting actors (especially Tandy). The plot is absolute escapist romantic fare, which I'll leave others to describe. While on the surface the main catch may seem far-fetched, it's handled with surprising credibility; one cannot help but feel caught up in the lovers' dilemma. Given their once-in-a-million opportunity, would any of us have done anything different? Can we judge them?   But, despite the outstanding acting and story, the real stars here are the music and the Italian settings. The haunting song ""September Affair,"" played in the film, was recorded shortly before Walter Huston's death and released posthumously; the poignancy of this fact, and the skillful usage in the film, made both a huge sensation. The captivating black-and-white Italian scenery, especially in Rome and Capri (check out the awesome sequence in the cave at Capri) is worth watching just by itself - much of the same would be captured later in Technicolor (but not as effectively) in the film Rome Adventure. An unforgettable viewing experience; if you love escapism and romance, don't miss this one."
2,"The action of ""A Cold Night's Death"" takes place at an isolated research laboratory in Antarctica and involves two scientists played by Eri Wallach and Robert Culp.They have come to replace the last scientist who worked at the outpost who apparently went mad and killed himself by leaving a window open and slowly freezing to death.The more time our inquisitive friends spend in the outpost,the more paranoid and suspicious they become,both of their surroundings and of each other.Something is definitely amiss and each night brings them closer to the truth behind what really happened to their predecessor.""The Chill Factor"" provides plenty of bleak snowbound atmosphere of dread and severe isolation.The acting by two leads is excellent and the final moment is utterly chilling.A perfect example of brilliant TV-horror that perfectly conveys the fear of unseen.8 out of 10."
1,"sammo has to have a 10 out of 10 for this movie as it has everything. great story, great fights, great characters and great cameos.  this film sees dick wei take on billy chow and chong fat. sammo takes on lau kar leung in a casino, sammo loses the fight but what a fight it is full of high tempo action and elements of comedy thrown in.  some great and touching moments in the film, lam ching ying pops up in a cameo and gets killed off - gutted.  the end sequence will have you reaching for the rewind button, as its one of the best end fights I've seen. sammo takes on loads of guys and ends up squaring up to billy chow."
2,"Other than seeing Pink Floyd play together probably for the very last time ever, this whole fiasco was a gigantic waste of time. I'm sorry, I know we all want to believe it was a great event helping people in Africa, that signing petitions online does something (I call this slactivism) but I'm afraid to say it wasn't and they don't.  What we have is a bunch of aging and not so aging rockers and pop stars patting themselves on the back and stroking their collective egos by playing for hundreds of thousands of people (live) and millions on TV and the web. Its a great big feel good fest, the musicians get to play for a large crowd, and the audience gets off the hook, they don't have to do anything but watch one of the most fantastic lineups ever. At least when the SARS-AID show in Toronto was going to help Toronto recover from the SARS epidemic. What did this event do? ""Raise awareness"" they say, well how many people really understand the issues in Africa? I do probably more than most, but I still don't really know why the hell Africa is such bad shape. I don't really know why the AIDS epidemic has hit Africa so hard. Is it just pure poverty? Was is the root cause of this poverty? Is it dictatorships? Foreign debt? That seems to be main focus of guys like Bono, but realistically what how does a concert help this? Do you really think that the leaders of the free world give a damn that bunch of people go together to listen to some music? I'm sorry, call me cynical, I do think music is important and effects our lives in a meaningful way but when I think Geldof has kind of lost his mind. He stands there so proud of himself, but is there any surprise that so many people would watch the most popular musical acts in the world? It could have had nothing to do with Africa, it could have been to celebrate sponges and people still would have shown up.  I am sorry, in 1985 it seemed magical, but it's a movie sequel, too polished, quite expected and simply a rehash of what we've already seen."
2,"I love Stephen King - I read most of his books (not this one)and there are some good (and of course some bad) Stephen King movies!  But this movie is really really bad! Made by Lawrence Kasdan and starring some fine actors like Morgan Freeman, Damien Lewis, Tom Sizemore...I expected at least an entertaining movie; but it isn't even that! The acting is poorly, the story seems...... lost in the storm and the special effects look rather silly. The only advise I can give anybody who hasn't seen this movie yet is: try READING THE BOOK because this movie is awful!  "
2,"CHUD only good point is the idea behind the plot. Monsters in the subway is a somewhat underplayed B-movie idea that could use some more cinematic tries. -- The movie drags a bit, and is somewhat mundane in its approach and execution, but is worth watching none the less. I only gave it a ""4"" though, maybe because the middle of the movie dragged, and I was expecting better special effects than the movie could deliver."
2,"As usual, Clint Eastwood gives an excellent performance as a detective in charge of finding a serial killer. This movie was made prior to the glamorization of ""serial killers"" in which the focus is on the weird, whacked-out antics of the deranged killer rather on normal people. Clint is also a single father of two young girls and the growing similarities between the haunts of the killer and the cop becomes a cause for concern."
0,"What is interesting is that the acting; was not bad, just not enough. It was rather lame., special effects nor the lines were the single culprit for this failure. Standing alone they weren't horribly bad, but put together was a tragic move. The show seemed long winded and slow with special effects apparently designed to speed the movie along, but it failed totally.  Much of the blame for this disaster was put on special effects.Don't believe it, they were kinda cool. Appleby was not the best choice for this endeavor. Though she may have been all they had to chose from with a bit of fan recogniton. An experienced actress would have brought something to the part, like Appleby never did. Scfi puts out some really good original movies, it's just too bad that this failed so drastically."
2,"This is a wonderful movie from the Soviet Union that follows one simple soldier for the course of less than a week. Pvt. Alyosha Skvortsov is on the battlefield running from an oncoming German tank. He is scared half to death but manages, in his panic, to jump into a fox hole where he finds a bazooka-like gun and destroys the tank. Moments later, another German tank appears and he dispatches that one as well! The German tanks not hit are in a panic and make a hasty retreat. Later, the private is brought to the general where he is congratulated and told he would get a medal for his bravery. Skvortsov instead asks if perhaps he could have a pass to see his mother--and the general agrees.  However, the pass is only for a few days and despite Skvortsov insisting he could make it home in a day or so, there is a war on and it takes so much longer to get home than he anticipated. In fact, he is taken from touching vignette to touching vignette--all told marvelously and with such heart. One soldier who sees him heading away from the front begs him to stop on the way home and bring some soap to his wife and tell her he is okay. How this all works itself out was amazingly honest and touching. Even more touching was the one-legged veteran he meets who is also on the way home. The guy doesn't believe that his wife would like him back--particularly with the injury. But, Skvortsov is such a decent guy that he takes time out of his leave to force the guy to go home and not run away. This leads to one of the most touching reunions you'll ever see. Additionally, the young soldier also happens to meet a pretty young lady on a train and falls in love with her (reminiscent of the film THE CLOCK). Ultimately, he does arrive home for an all-too-brief moment where you'll likely shed a tear or two.  The film is marvelous and honest. Instead of the jingoistic propaganda film this would have been had it been made during the war, a few years had passed and the film has a more realistic focus. The extreme bravery, fear, decency and bad in people are all explored and as a result the film seems so real. Also, the whole look of the war was achieved so well. The German tanks are actually German tanks (thanks to countless tanks abandoned by fleeing Germans during the war)--something you just don't see in American films because they aren't available. The battlefields look stark and vivid. And, in a good nod to realism, one soldier eats canned meat that clearly has an American label on it (something Stalin NEVER would have allowed in a film--since he ALONE is why the Russians prevailed, or so it would have been portrayed if the film had been made before his death in 1953).  I can compare this film favorably to many of the great war films that explore real human beings--such as THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES or the recent film ENEMY AT THE GATES. A masterpiece of honesty and humanity."
0,"Mona the vagabond lives on the fringes of French society, in a life without meaning, purpose or direction.  I watched this because of all the stellar reviews, but I'm afraid I must have missed something. The character of Mona has little or no personality while drifting through life being rude to people, getting high and contributing nothing to anyone's life. She's not interesting or exciting. She's just useless.  I've seen and known enough people like that: there is no secret meaning to what they're doing. They are just lazy bums. I wouldn't want Mona anywhere near me, as she tends to steal anything that isn't nailed down and leave her friends in the lurch. Sure she's enigmatic - because there isn't anything to her. Lots of junkies, winos and bums I've seen are enigmatic; I wouldn't want to see a film about them either.  Possibly there is something there that I totally missed. Otherwise I'm assuming that all the reviews are from people who assume anything done by a French female director is high art."
2,"Famed martial arts choreographer Cory Yuen (THE TRANSPORTER 1 & 2, X-MEN and ROMEO MUST DIE) directed a Hong Kong film, loaded with bone-crushing stunts and masterful fight scenes with an assembled cast of martial arts masters from the East and West to cross paths.  ABOVE THE LAW (aka RIGHTING WRONGS) obtained a vigilante story with dark toned aspects that relies on police corruption and the righteous bending the law to seek their own justice. The stunning martial arts choreography by Cory Yuen kicks into high gear to help make this underrated cop-fu classic a fan favorite.  Acrobatic kung-fu genius Yuen Biao (ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA, SHANGHAI EXPRESS (aka MILLIONAIRE'S EXPRESS), THE PRODIGAL SON) plays a court prosecutor whose relentless determination to do away with an untouchable gangster (James Tien- Bruce Lee's THE BIG BOSS, FIST OF FURY) has led him to employ a series of unethical tactics. His investigation becomes complicated by the arrival of a female inspector (played by 5-Time World Karate champion and weapons expert Cynthia Rothrock).  Out of all the '80s era fight flicks I have seen Yuen Biao perform in, ABOVE THE LAW was one of his better efforts as an actor and screen fight performer. He exchanges blows with undefeated kickboxing legend Peter ""Sugarfoot"" Cunningham in a (POLICE STORY-style) glass-shattering fight, he also battles Cynthia Rothrock in an engagement of traditional kung-fu, acrobatic fight moves and handcuffs. He has a Jackie Chan stunt moment where he uses his speed and flexibility to dodge speeding cars.  Cory Yuen staged these sequences wonderfully and the legendary fight between Cynthia and Biao shows their similarities in timing and skill, which makes their battle an all-time favorite. Karen Shepard, who is another skilled fighter from America and an expert in the mixed art form of Wun Hop Kuen Do kung fu, faces off against Cynthia with the lethal chain whip. Actor Melvin Wong (EASTERN CONDORS and DESCENDANT OF WING CHUN- the film referred in BULLETPROOF MONK-) also gets screen time to execute some martial arts against Yuen Biao. The results of the screen fights earned the film a nomination for Best Action Choreography at the 1987 Hong Kong Film Awards.  Of course, fans already know that Cynthia Rothrock is kung-fu's queen of action and a master in various forms of combat like Tae Kwon Do, Wushu, Northern Shaolin kung-fu and Tang Soo Do. Her skills made her a celebrated icon in the sport but unfortunately, she remains highly underrated and overshadowed by the mainstream success of Jackie Chan and Jet Li. Her roles in countless American movies suffer from bad plots and choreography but her presence in Hong Kong films shine like Jackie Chan, and Jet Li does internationally. Her capabilities give her the advantage over many of today's mainstream martial art stars and it is disappointing that her films in the East do not get the proper recognition.  For a film made in the '80s, ABOVE THE LAW was a great actioner in martial arts cinema, and all the skilled experts did a great job with their performance.  I hope the overshadowing of this classic in the West will end with the new Dragon Dynasty release and capture a wider audience to gain her the type of recognition she deserves as a star.  This film was also one of Cynthia and Biao's best performances in screen combat during that era but the praise goes to Cory Yuen because of his skillful direction and casting of martial arts action figures from both worlds to pull the strings. This film will remain a classic in the cinema of martial arts and an unforgettable clashing of two legends in martial arts that deserve the proper recognition."
2,"There was a brief flourishing during the Seventies of using the Negev desert in Israel as location for the filming of westerns. I imagine that now with those rockets flowing from the Gaza, no film company wants to go there. In any event I suppose you could call these things bagel westerns.  Quality wise they're not all that different from some of the mediocre European spaghetti westerns being churned out on that continent, even with American players like Lee Van Cleef, John Marley, and Jim Brown starring in them.  Kid Vengeance stars a kid, Leif Garrett in the days right before he became a pop bubblegum teen idol. Van Cleef and Marley and their gang kill his father and kill and rape his mother and sister Glynis O'Connor stows away on their outlaw wagon. Talk about not too much smarts.  Anyway young Leif is out for blood, but the most androgynous teen idol until Michael Jackson never really makes you feel he's all that bloodthirsty. Garrett also meets Jim Brown, a miner who the outlaws have robbed and left tied up and stretched out to die. Garrett comes him free and the two of them join forces to get the gang that did them dirt.  The climax which I can't reveal is hokey beyond belief, the most unbelievable western showdown ever filmed. This film just might have killed the Israeli western business more than the Arabs."
2,"Entire film wasn't brilliant. Boring at moments, banal structure, but still worth to watch it! Why? Becuose every kids in Poland know that ""kiedys chlop zakladal babie chomato i oral nia pole!"" or ""chcialbym byc jak Tony Halik"". Polish teenage society is cruel, so I also MUST know few lines from such films as ""Killer"" or ""Poranek Kojota"" to survive.  I admit that many jokes are hard to understand, if you are not polish.  Laska (with his ganja-mutated voice) is the best! Typical teenage from Warsaw! Dublicate of my school-friends...   10 for Laska's character, 6 for all the rest. Average: 8."
2,"In yet another Seduction Cinema soft-core parody, Dildo Baggins (Misty Mundae, because she can NEVER not be in a Seduction Cinema movie *rolls eyes*) along with fellow Throbbit lesbian lovers, Horny and Spam go off to destroy the evil G-string, after drunk perverted Smirnof, the Wizard presents that quest to them. Wackiness, in the form of dumb jokes, unerotic sex, and more dumb puns, ensues. Terry West will never be confused with Orsen Wells, hell, he'll never get confused with Lloyd Kaufman even, but this ""Lord of the Rings"" parody is still his clear best, and yes I know that's a bit of a back-handed compliment. I chuckled a few times, but groaned more and not in the good way.  My Grade: D+   DVD Extras: almost hour long documentary; 37 minute Behind the scenes featurette; a lame music video; and the usual Seduction Cinema trailers   Eye Candy: everyone gets fully nude multiple times  Easter Eggs: highlight the tree for more behind the scenes footage; highlight the head for an interview with John Link"
2,"Steven Soderbergh has the knack of draining the passion out of his films (The Good German, The Informant) in a myriad of ways and with his reverential Che Part One he applies them all. Sloppy composition, repetitive detail to the trivial, disjointed editing that looks like it was cut with a machete and lack of character development in anyone except St.Che who more resembles Gandhi than the charismatic and fervent revolutionary who was prone to atrocity (""Can't have a revolution without firing squads""-Lenin).  Part One covers Che's triumphant Cuban guerrilla war from 1956-1959 that brought down the brutal dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. It is clumsily cross cut with Guevera's speech at the UN after Fidel takes power (thankfully color coded in B&W to tell us where we are) and the jarring transitions further impede the films flow save for Che re-phrasing his humanist viewpoint ad nauseum. In the field it gets even more inane as Soderbergh has Che command his followers in a gentle voice that can hardly be heard above the crickets and birds. He's acts more like a parent with recalcitrant teens than rebels and in one case orders sulking soldiers to return a freshly liberated set of hot wheels. Soderbergh lays it on even thicker with his gracious door to door visits to peasants' homes for food, begging and always paying. Che also spends more time doctoring, reading and tutoring math than engaging the enemy, though he does manage at one point to assert action hero status grabbing a bazooka from an inept subordinate and firing a direct hit. Soderbergh completes his canonization by closing Part One with the victorious Che 200 miles out of Havana and for good reason since it would be difficult for his lead to maintain an ethereal demeanor while ordering mass executions without trial.  Looking and speaking in the compassionate tone of an apostle, Bernicio Del Toro shows little of the drive and intensity that Che had to have had to triumph against overwhelming odds. Instead we get an introspective Che in heroic pose reading and writing in his journal and stressing education. The rest of the cast is marginalized including an ambiguous Fidel.  With Che Part One Soderbergh ultimately does Guevera a disservice by sanitizing him and in doing so sucks the vitality and complexity out of a man who by his accomplishments had a lot more about him than is said in this ponderous quagmire of a film."
2,"Despite the incredible premise, this is only slightly amusing. There are a handful of moments where you will laugh out loud, but the storyline fails to hold your interest in between. It's actually a pretty boring movie, and the pacing is very slow.  The scene where he receives all his gadgets is very funny and at that point I thought I was gonna have a good time with the movie, but it starts to fall apart pretty quickly after that. Watching Agent 00 fight guys that are three times his size is fun for about 30 minutes, but it quickly becomes predictable and the action scenes have a total lack of tension... In fact, the whole movie lacks tension or urgency. I almost fell asleep twice.  I'm actually glad this movie was made and I'm glad I own it. It's one of the most bizarre and silly things you could ever imagine and I'm happy to live in a world where such a crazy thing could exist, but the whole thing just doesn't come together or deliver any entertainment value. It's one of those movies where I would show it to my friends, but I would fast forward to the good parts. I would never actually ask them to endure the entire film."

2,"Having seen Sur mes levres and liked it a lot, and having read reviews of this one that made it sound even better, I had high expectations.  Alas, my initial disappointment with the opening scenes was confirmed as the film went on. I couldn't believe a single character except the father's mistress, Christine, played by Emmanuelle Devos, who made the film live for the two brief scenes in which she appeared. The first of those was quite early on, and I thought that the film was going to pull itself together and turn into something really good; but she disappeared then until another short scene quite close to the end.  I found Romain Duris' performance tedious. He was not bad at the gangster bits, I suppose; but as a classical pianist, he was embarrassing to watch. To be fair, the character was just not credible -- you can't think of becoming a concert pianist if you are 28 years old and haven't practised for 10 years -- but all the swaying and drooping and bellows of anguish were so ridiculous that at times I had difficulty continuing to watch.  I have no idea what point the director thought he was trying to make, and I don't think he had much of an idea either. Was he showing that it was possible to change, or that it was not?  A complete waste of time, unfortunately. I just wish there were more films around with Emanuelle Devos. For an awkward woman with no real beauty, she has a presence and a power of attraction that are hard to withstand -- and I for one would have no wish to withstand them even if I could."
0,"Whether you watch the regular version of this monstrosity or the MST3K version, you can only be impressed by the utter GALL that went into this production. The filmmakers insult the viewer's intelligence from one end to the other and obviously couldn't care less that they are doing so.  Everything about it is rock-bottom cheap. Even the 1950s car in the flashback sequence to that era looks like it was hauled out of a junkyard.  The ""hobgoblins"" are, as you probably know, ""realized"" with badly-crafted hand puppets and stuffed toys; when a person is supposed to be attacked by them, it's clear the toy is being held by the victim to his or her own body. When the critters scurry away from the two security guards, this is shown (or rather, not shown) by the camera aiming UP at the guards as they look down and turn their heads as if watching the hobgoblins scurrying past. It's reminiscent of the scene in the film ""Tangents"" where two people are standing in the ruins of a future world, surveying the wreckage, and we aren't shown any of it. Budget constraints alloyed with utter incompetence generally mean you won't have anything worth showing, so why try? The ""sets"" were utterly laughable. ""Club Scum"" was an obvious diner; the house appears to have been a vacant house --probably for rent or sale-- which the production company got hold of for an hour or two to do the shoot. The ""spacecraft"" is something I would have been ashamed to build when I was a model-making 10 year-old.  The motivations of the characters make no sense-- Kevin gets denigrated by his worthless ingrate of a girlfriend because he hasn't made her ""proud of him."" I'm sure this was intended to make their reconciliation oh so touching at the end, but any guy with real self-respect would have told her to go to hell and left her. Nick is supposedly back from 2 months of Army training (yeah, nice regulation haircut, Nick,) and seems bent on proving that our country is being defended by sadistic, moronic animals who are sex maniacs. Kyle is a phone-sex freak in red shorts who dreams of a night with a spandex-clad dominatrix type, but he's so effeminate that he's more likely gay than not. One of the girls is a prude and the other is a sleaze.  And the hobgoblins? At the end they all head back to the vault where they've lived for 30 years. Why? Who knows? Who cares? Watch this film and be amazed at how primitive film-making in our modern age can be when you have an idiotic script, incompetent direction, actors who are so bad they'd be rejected from a high school theater production, and sets worthy of Edward D. Wood, Jr."
0,"Jason Lee's pecks are back! If that's what you are looking for, look no further. If not, better move on...  But about the movie. Clichés galore, some poorly shot but kinda exotic fight scenes (used JKD) and lots of bad acting & cheap effects. Poor Lee looks like he's in pain throughout the movie, and no wonder. Not a pleasant comeback.  The movie doesn't even cut it as a B-movie - sure, there was a Germanish bleached blonde Rutger-wannabe bad guy, but no gratuitous sex scene or even a single booty shots. None. Zip. Nada. Even in Starship Troopers 2 they had the common sense to include the mandatory nudie scenes (as for rest of my comments on that excellent piece of classic cinema excellence, please refer to our upcoming review on that mind-blowing sequel...). I did get the feeling that the writer was taking his revenge on somebody with this - thus I won't get into the ""plot"" of the movie or pretty much anything else related. Except that it did have some non-heterosexual overtones, so 'nuff said.  However, this movie has one thing going for it - no Jean-Claude :)"
0,"A real head scratcher of a film by Bill Rebane who appeared to be getting worse in his trade throughout the eighties. Three crackpot millionaires invite nine people to a remote hotel to compete in a last person standing contest in which the final contestant will be given $1 million provided he or she makes it that far. A series of lame pranks are pulled on some of the guests while the others engage in what most adults would do under the circumstances namely get shatfaced at the hotel bar. Most scenes are merely an excuse to focus the camera on various female body parts including an opening dance number that is a crossover of American Bandstand meets geriatric aerobics complete with hookers. If there was any hesitation that white people can't dance this scene hammers the final nail in that coffin. Pay close attention for the nipple slip. This continues on for about forty-five minutes until Bill Rebane begins throwing darts at various plot twists and whatever he hits becomes the inspiration for the next scene making this one incoherent mess. It's a game until it's not a game. The three old coots are in complete control until they're not. The hotel is possessed by a supernatural force until it becomes just props. They're dead until they're not. Even the narrator at the end replies that he doesn't know what the hell happened. I defy anyone to reason where Rebane was going on this one. The acting is dinner theater caliber minus the dinner. Most of the actors probably went back to their day jobs at the local Stuckey's. I give it a few points for the scene where the yuppie broad opens the closet and a skeleton is inside skull humping himself. Let's see Gone With the Wind do that! This Chilling Classics collection is really becoming the bane of me. Bane, Get it! Like Rebane! I hate myself."
2,"""Scottish-Asian woman returns home to save her family's ailing restaurant."" That was the scant, not to mention inaccurate synopsis that I read before viewing. I rather expected a dull, perhaps gritty story of a dysfunctional family with likely a bit of outside racism thrown in for good measure. But hey, it was set in Scotland and we don't see too many films like that so I sat down to watch... So what a treat I got!! This film is well-acted (especially by the two leads) and utterly engaging. I agree parts of the plot were wafer thin but it presented as a fairytale and a cracking good one at that. It was just joyful and poignant and above all uplifting. I am Scottish but neither Asian or gay so others can discuss any significance about such matters, for me it was just a great watch and that is all I care about."
2,"Flirtacious Lily (the stunningly gorgeous Stefanie Von Pfetten) and aggressive Constance (the equally foxy Kim Poirier) aren't your standard run-of-the-mill tasty hot blonde college babes. They are actually dangerously alluring and enticing extraterrestrials who have come to Earth to mate with human males. Unfortunately, these delectable intergalactic honeys cause men to freeze from the inside out while having sex with them. Plus they sprout icky tentacles when aroused and don't have navels. It's up to aimless slacker freshman Luke (winningly played by Corey Sevier) to stop them before they turn every last libidinous party hearty dude on campus into giant frosty popsicles.  Director/co-screenwriter Matthew Hastings has an absolute infectiously inane ball with the enjoyably ridiculous premise, skillfully blending raucous humor and off-center horror into a highly amusing and entertaining synthesis. Moreover, Hastings keeps the pace speeding along at a brisk tempo, elicits spirited acting from a fresh, attractive and appealing young cast, and stages the shock scenes with rousing go-for-it aplomb. Daniel Villeneuve's crisp, fluid cinematography, the catchy, thrashin' rock soundtrack, the nifty special effects, a smidgen of nudity, genuinely likable characters, the shivery'n'spooky score by Daryl Bennet and Jim Guttridge, the stirring conclusion, and a dandy surprise twist ending are all up to par. Elias Toufexis is an amiably goofy hoot as the sweet virginal Roger, Meghan Ory registers strongly as Luke's scrappy'n'spunky best gal pal Alex, former ""Baywatch"" TV show regular Nicole Eggert pops up as a feisty lady cop, and Richard Burgi jerks it up delightfully as a gruff homicide detective. Good, solid tongue-in-cheek Grade B sci-fi/horror fun."
2,"I've seen many movies lately, but this one won my heart. Summer's end brings to you the warmth of a sincere friendship between a man and a young boy, but more than that, it shows this friendship as it's seen by the boy, who is capable of anything to keep this relationship based on trust and love...  I can compare this movie to Mel Gibson's The Man Without a Face, where again we have a great movie about a friendship between a man and a boy, both overcoming all the hate that comes from the people around them."
2,"I am a European living in USA for 3 years and always exited to watch a non- Hollywood movie. I have seen a lot that involves guys in this movie and around them. Loved almost everything I saw. So I was very eager to see some new work. I have never heard about the book (until I read some other comments) but I hope it was better then this. So what if he is in love, we all are. Are we thinking of going nuts about it? Sometimes. We have seen this kinda staff too many times. And all that nudity. Only good thing about it is that is all natural, which gives us somewhat soft touch. But still did not understand anything the movie tries to tell us.  I never think watching a movie is a waste of time, though this one came close!!!"
2,"Ever since I first heard that the book by Erling Jepsen was being put into a movie I have been anticipating its release since I have read the book with much pleasure and since I have actually worked on that mental institution Sanne is committed to.  It's a story of a family of five, where the oldest brother has left home to study, who are being manipulated by their father who is a neurotic Patriarch. He is the hysterical type, loaded with feelings of inferiority. This combination makes him go on a constant search for reassurance and comfort in a very egocentric fashion to a point where his wife simply gives up and instead either takes sleeping pills or challenges him to commit suicide. His youngest son, Allan, tries to help his father as he has not yet reached a point of maturity that allows him to see through his father behavior and understand it as manipulative. In doing so he becomes just as manipulative but we symphatize and forgive him as we understand that he does it out of innocence and loyalty to his father. As the story develops so does Allan and finally the alliance between him and his father is broken as he becomes more aware of the consequences of his father's actions.  The movie takes place in the 1970's and there has clearly been put a lot of effort into making the environment typical of it's time with great success. The acting is flawless and I think it was a wise choice to let young Allan play his part in a very subtly and restrained way. This also makes the sinister themes more bearable to watch as Allan seems more or less unaffected.  I would really recommend this movie; it gives a humorous portrayal of some very important themes without ever betraying them.  Mojn Simon"
2,"overall, i'd say that this movie could have been worse. the scene where they kidnap & tattoo the rapist is worth it. the music was really lacking; the band's name was awful and the music was awful. drea dematteo (sp?) was the best part (Tracy) because she had the most authentic rock & roll lady thing going on...she must have done her homework on donita sparks (L7). there is (obviously) a rape in the movie, but you don't really see it--thank gawd. there is some awkward violence right before hand, but where most films would show the actual rape, the director cut to a black screen. there were a lot of predictable moments, but it was fun nevertheless. i believe it went straight to video, and i understand why."
1,"Though this series only ran a season, it has stayed with me for 20 years. It was by far and above my all time favorite cartoon ever. I would give nearly anything to have it on DVD or whatever format I can get. If you find any means of seeing this series I suggest you take full advantage. This series was the first one (in my opinion) that had a truly coherent storyline that spanned across multiple episodes. It also made me truly care about the characters and what happened to them. Heck the character Goose actually scared me sometimes. He was just that odd at the time. Also the leader of the group reminds me a lot of a combination of Clint Eastwood/Tommy Lee Jones. If anyone has any way of contacting the creator/holder of the rights to the series and can get them put out on DVD please by all means do so!!!"
1,"In her autobiography,Laureen Bacall reveals that Bogie told her that she should not make such dud movies as this one or something like that.At the time,Douglas Sirk was labeled ""weepies for women"",actually,he was restored to favor,at least in Europa,after he stopped directing.And when he filmed ""written on the wind"" ,Sirk had only three movies to make:""tarnished Angels"",""A time to love and a time to die"",his masterpiece,IMHO,and finally"" Imitation of life""(1960).Then there was silence. Actually Bacall and Hudson characters do not interest Sirk.They are too straight,too virtuous.Dorothy Malone -who was some kind of substitute for his former German star Zarah Leander-and her brother Robert Stack provide the main interest of the plot.A plot constructed continuously ,most of the movie being a long flashback.The instability of the brother and the sister ,from a family of rich Texan oil owners,is brought to the fore by garish clothes,and rutilant cars that go at top speed in a derricks landscape. Malone's metamorphosis at the end of the movie is stunning :suit and chignon,toying with a small derrick:she's ready for life,the rebel is tamed. Now alone,because she's lost Hudson (but anyway,he was not in love with her).This end is a bit reactionary,but melodrama is par excellence reactionary;three years later,in ""imitation of life"",Sarah-Jane (Susan Kohner) will be blamed because she does not know her place."
1,"Lupin sets off for Morocco, looking for a legendary treasure. His only clue is an interesting jewel that an old man gave him. It's a nice different location for Lupin, with the desert and that hot exotic feel.  One interesting thing about this movie is that Jigen has a much smaller role than usual, generally being in a different place than Lupin. On one hand their classic dynamic together is missed, but it is a change of pace. Plus, this way, Lupin can focus on the ladies...  Fujiko rules in this. Throughout the entire feature she is seducing Lupin, and us viewers. Then there's Lara, the damsel of this particular tale, and she's quite likable. This one has more nudity than any other Lupin anime, which is a fun distinction to have.  There's a very entertaining effeminate ninja guy who's the best villain in this, and naturally he has some great fighting with Goemon, as well as some fun scenes with Fujiko. Inspector Zenigata of course is also on a warpath here, in fine form.  Pretty much, this is a smooth ride with Lupin. The plot is average and there are some slow spots, but all in all this movie is a real pleasure. Enjoy."
2,"Seriously, I can't believe anyone was even remotely interested in putting this on television. I caught the tail end of the ""hand"" portion and hated my life for however long that took to finish. There was little else on broadcast television. If there were, however, I wouldn't be writing this; I'd have changed the channel and enjoyed living and breathing.  As I write this, a new chapter has opened up, quickly becoming the obvious cliché it sets out to describe. How ironic! That was sarcasm.   This is one of the worst things I've ever opted to leave on in the periphery. As far as leaving the television on for noise is concerned, you're better off sitting in silence."
1,"""The first war to be 100% outsourced."" Dan Ackroyd's line says it all. This is a hard to describe film; comedy, satire, action, screwball. It reminded once or twice of Dr. Strangelove, especially so in the scenes featuring Ben Kingsley (who did a remarkable job I think). I had no particular expectations of this film, though I am a big John Cusack fan, so I just let the movie wash over me. And as a result I was quite entertained. The political satire is painfully accurate and quite damning of the US military-business complex. The sub-plots were somewhat predictable but the final interweaving of story lines made them all worthwhile. I can understand why this film was not terribly popular in the US, but for the rest of the world, it is a timely tale."
2,"I can imagine every kid who ever saw this film begged, and I mean BEGGED their parents for a Mogwai for Xmas!!! I probably did, I can't remember. And even if I did, I wouldn't admit to it!!!  This film is great. Spielberg had a hand in this film somewhere, you can feel it. Yep, this one appeals to both kids and adults.  A nice plot, some great SFX and animatronics, and some good acting make this a film for nearly everyone.  The initial story, about a boy who gets a cute, fluffy pet for Christmas, is known to everyone. The Mogwai itself is sooooooo cute, and the way it speaks and sings furthers it's cute appeal. So it comes as a shock when the boy who owns him ends up breaking the three important rules that he must abide by, and all hell breaks loose!!!  Don't feed them after midnight. Don't get water on them. Don't ever expose them to sunlight!  All of these rules are broken, and what ensues is comic/horror chaos.  The Gremlins themselves are nasty little things. Grrrrrr!!! They can either be out-and-out menacing, funny and stupid, or both at the same time. It was nice to see the mixture of comedy and horror in this film, and it works all the better for it.  The music plays a pivotal role in letting us know when we should be scared or when we should laugh. It's a weird kinda sound that is made and works well enough to suit the mood of the film.  The one-on-one between Billy and the Stripe, is actually very tense, and violent. I mean Chainsaw's, razor sharp blades? Phew!  My review has so far been a mixture of comments in no particular order, so without more time being wasted, go and watch this film.  9/10  Enjoy!"
2,"I see by the copyright this thing is six years old but does it ever have a lot of relevance to today's scary post 9-11 world where a violent ""superhero's"" actions make the world safe by storying a lot of it. Ignore the people who rag on the ""deliberately primitive"" animation -- they clearly don't get it. Frankly the political and sociological subtext of Hoverboy is likely beyond them. Watch it with an open mind; you're bound to learn something about the human condition and may even realize that our leaders (from McCarthy to the current administration and politicians on both sides of the spectrum) have long used fear to push their own agendas.  Do yourself a favor: watch this thing if you can find it and tell your friends to do the same.   Long Live Hoverboy!"
2,"The Edinburgh Festival would seem to be an excellent theme for a film, with so much going on in a vibrant, photogenic city. This film, however proves this not to be such a good idea. It is a real mess, it has no focus, instead following several different story lines with no depth or conviction. The characters are ill-conceived and two dimensional, the stories poorly written and clichéd. All this is particularly disappointing giving this is the same writer/director (Annie Griffin) who made the brilliant TV series 'the Book Group'. The whole film has the feeling that was a rushed affair. Potential viewers would be best advised to avoid this film, instead saving the money towards a trip to Edinburgh to visit the festival for real - a far more rewarding experience."
2,"If you are really bored.... Watch this movie. The insipid ""hit men"" at the beginning of movie set the tone. The only worth while line is from the Protagonist when he finally catches up to his clone..... ""Get in there Xerox.""  "
2,"Paul Newman as a P.I. in Southern California, searching for truth among the wealthy -- shades of Harper and the Drowning Pool! Throw in Gene Hackman, Liev Schriber, James Garner, and John Spencer and how can a girl possibly go wrong watching Twilight?   It starts quite well. Newman, giving the film noir detective's narration in perfect form, sets the stage well and gets us quite interested in his life and perspective. Hackman, Sarandon, Reese Witherspoon, and Schriver chime in with very interesting characters. We appear to be in for a treat.  But, then it goes nowhere, except cliche-land. The result is dreary and listless as unmotivated characters go through the motion. The ending turns the interest level back up somewhat, but not enough to salvage the overall experience. Rent Harper instead."
1,"(WARNING: minor spoilers)  I ran into this one partway through and watched from there, not knowing what it was or what the plot was. It certainly held my attention; I didn't know until the ending that it was based on a true story! The guy she used to do the dirty deed came out looking like a seriously nice guy who just got his head twisted around by a devious girl; I have to question how true to life that portrayal is. Anyone who would murder a husband and wife as they slept just can't be entirely nice. Still, I did have some sympathy for him, as he had been set up and taken advantage of; that much was made clear.  My main complaint is with the ending (here comes the biggest spoiler! skip this paragraph if you don't want to learn it). A few minutes before it ended, there seemed no way for the truth to be discovered. The way it got discovered was in a ""sting"" operation, but my question is: how did the police get convinced to go along with it? The movie didn't show us that, and it seemed a bit too convenient absent the explanation of how they were persuaded to do it.  I think the way they handled that was done for dramatic purposes, as the omission of the explanation lent an aura of suspense to the crucial scene which otherwise wouldn't have been there (we would already have known what the scene was about, and what was going on with Brad in it).  Otherwise, this is a pretty good film; I give it 7/10. It made me think. Now I'm interested to find out the facts of the real case.  One more thing: the movie was done in 1996. Some of the reviews here seem to be treating it as a more recent movie.  P.S. Meadow Sisto is lovely. I hadn't seen her before. She can act a little, too (always a plus in her line of work, LOL)."
2,"Perhaps in the 70's this movie had some appeal, but I cannot think of any good reason anyone would want to watch it now. With thousands of other rentals available this should be your last choice. I wish I could get the two hours I spent watching this movie back. If you have any respect for quality films, please take my advice and pass this one up."
2,"I was on an overnight pass from the Army in 1969 when this movie was playing. My buddies and I thought it might be a good movie. We were starved for entertainment. This movie was so disappointing. It was too heavy for us, We were about to leave for Vietnam and wanted to see something light. Maybe I was too young or it was the events of my life at the time. But we all thought it was bad. I have remembered this movie all my life, as it was the last one I saw in the US. I do admit the the cast was good, that was why we chose that one. I have always liked Kirk. But in the end we found it depressing. I would watch it again if it ever came on TV, Just so that I could make another judgment after all these years."
2,"I'm not a huge science fiction fan, but I love this show. It's a great comedy with spaceships, planets, and alternate dimensions as simple backdrops. The characters are extremely likeable and the situations are very funny. Unfortunately, this show is hard to see in the states, but if you have a chance, WATCH IT! You won't be disappointed."

Who's the moron that decided that Jessica Simpson is hot?! We know she can't act but come on. In the TV show Daisy was a fox and brunette.  All members who contributed in these waste of time please please please don't even think about makin a sequel, a prequel or anything that's got 2 do with a former TV show.  I gave a empty DVD so this ""movie"" could be burned 4 me. I sat trough it and i want my money back!"
2,"I am a huge fan of zombie movies, which is the only reason why this movie would land in anyone's hands. But listen, and listen carefully: This was not only the worst zombie film I've ever seen, it may actually qualify as the worst of any film I've seen, period.  For anyone who says this film is realistic, that's hard to measure. If zombies stand there doing nothing while simultaneous scaring the crap out of everybody, then yes, it's very, very realistic.  But I doubt that is the case. They should have named it Zombie Matrix they way they had bullets flying around. I was embarrassed I made my girlfriend watch this."
2,"First season or two were great, but that is only what is worth in Andromeda... It seams that Sorbo fired writer and continued to create Andromeda so that he can look like a great hero. At the opening he was just 300 years old starship captain stuck at the edge of the black hole. Later we find out that he is special, and soon after that that he is a member of an ancient race. Also at the opening main characters were equal, an later there is only Hercules, sorry Capt Hunt and every one else is nothing more then a sidekick. And what the hell is the story with Tyr?!? that is the worst turnaround ever in the worst direction. It is sad to see what can one man's ego do to the great and promising show."
2,"About the only enjoyment I got out of the first two-thirds of this movie came from the fact that I was a History Major in College. The scenery was interesting and so was the commentary from the mother to her daughter. But other than that you're just waiting and waiting for something to happen. The only excitement, other than the very very end, is when John Malkovich finally shows up. However, I found his character far too fawning and pathetic. And then the final scene! Okay maybe there is some big point about history and civilization, the daughter goes back for her doll But does this bit of a twist at the end make up for an hour of bad writing and camera work? Who's giving this film a 10/10? Does it really warrant it? Considering all the great films produced (especailly when compared to some of the stinkers from Hollywood) how can this film get such a high rating from people?"
2,"I, along with other viewers,was duped into thinking that this was about a serial killer when in fact it was about an animal that kills humans. O.K. animals do this as it is part of their instinct & sometimes animals acquire a taste for blood. In this case the theory is that the ""Gator"" acquired this ""taste"" because of all the bloodshed from the civil war that had gone on for years in that country. Could be? All I know is that when I started watching the movie & realized that it was just another ""Gator"" movie I was not only disappointed, but just plain mad. Mad that I had been duped, but I am not alone as many of of my fellow movie goers will see!!........Very Disappointed!!!"
2,"This film is composed of elements that appeal to me but I was disappointed. The acting is journeyman quality and the cinematography is professional. The story is generally juvenile and poorly detailed, with some exceptions. Those good scenes made viewing less painful. The plot development tries, but fails to achieve a coherence and fails to allow the characters to become real. This leaves the movie as an 18 year old's fantasy of what he could do if he left his home town in anger and embarrassment and had hot chicks falling for him through a series of adventures while traveling on money provided by a cool dad living vicariously. The young hero accomplishes nothing on his own merit except for saving the trans-Darien expedition from a guerrilla band in a scene that rings so phony it would have worked better as a dream sequence. This is not a retelling of the universal stories of transformation through adversity or rites of passage. Although the central character grows a beard and looks older by the end of the movie he has not matured. Likewise, decent acting and production values have not created a mature or compelling film."
2,"Farley and Perry lead a team who are racing Lewis and Clark to blaze a trail to the Pacific coast of the newly settled America. Historically speaking, the setting of the film and costumes seem surprisingly accurate and I was totally convinced that I was looking at the early 1800's.  I watched it the first time and giggle a bit, I watched it the second time and laughed here and there, I watched it for the third time and laughed nearly all the way through! This film is like an acquired taste and just gets better with watching."
0,"There have been very few films I have not been able to sit through. I made it through Battle Field Earth no problem. But this, This is one of the single worst films EVER to be made. I understand Whoopi Goldberg tried to get of acting in it. I do not blame her. I would feel ashamed to have this on a resume. I belive it is a rare occasion when almost every gag in a film falls flat on it's face. Well it happens here. Not to mention the SFX, look for the dino with the control cables hanging out of it rear end!!!!!! Halfway through the film I was still looking for a plot. I never found one. Save yourself the trouble of renting this and save 90 minutes of your life."
2,"Any old time college movie has one plot: the big game, the big race, or the big dance, and the only way to bring it off is to sneak in a ringer from outside the school. This time it is the big race - a rowing race. (The rowing practice all takes place in front of a bizarre and inexplicable rear-projected vista of OIL WELLS.) Not even Mantan can pep up these proceedings - it doesn't make you suffer, nor is it anything to write home about. A pretty harmless way to kill an hour or so. If there is one memorable thing in the movie, and there is exactly one memorable thing, it is Gale Storm's first musical number - she is incredibly vivacious and sexy, in a dress which emphasizes her charms in a remarkable yet very chaste way. I may watch it again just for that. I don't think it's a spoiler to warn you that EVERYTHING TURNS OUT ALL RIGHT IN THE END. You already knew that."
2,"This is the American version of the French Taxi films and it suffers in comparison.  I'm not kidding when I say that this a remake of the three French films since although the film is mainly a poor remake of the the first film, it lifts sequences from the second and third films.   Its a mess, a real mess. I'm a huge huge fan of the French films, and for me there was no real point in my seeing this since anything that worked came from the originals.   Why did they bother? They changed the sex of the lead (though the Queen is excellent), combined others and rewrote the cops mother to the point of stupidness. They lost any sense of timing and connection...they should have started from the ground up.  Its not the painfully awful film that some reviews made it out to be, but it is a waste of time. If you can find the originals and watch those. That should take you the better part of 5 hours and in the end you will not feel as though you've wasted your life.  3 out of 10."
2,"Even with this being the first and only Jean Rollin movie I've watched so far (and having viewed a couple of trailers from his other efforts), I feel like I already have a pretty good idea of what this Frenchman stands for. While Rollin clearly is in the same league that produces  what many call  Euro-Trash movies, I think he is at least one step above Über-Euro-hack Jess Franco. Rollin at least has something Franco never had: The man's got style.  LA MORTE VIVANTE (AKA THE LIVING DEAD GIRL) tries to be a lot of things. One could say it's got some sort or 'arty' semblance or contains poetic visuals (e.g. after Catherine sets free the wounded girl from the catacombs, look at the exterior shot where she stumbles towards the water  the way it is lit, the red boat in contrast with the green grass, the shadows separating that scenery from the concrete of the castle-wall on the right, her white dress reflecting in the shimmering water, the violin playing on the soundtrack). Of course, there's a lot of female nudity at display throughout the whole movie (and for the girls: there's even a male generously providing a glimpse at his ding-dong too). However, Rollin somehow manages to give it an 'arty' touch (e.g. after Hélène discovered the bodies of the dead couple, she walks in on a naked Catherine playing the piano  just look at the shot where she's sitting naked behind the piano, her back facing Hélène), while in any given Franco movie you can't do anything but pass it off as cheap sleaze.  But all the possible merits this movie has, can't prevent you from feeling you are indeed watching a trashy Euro-Horror flick. The acting is barely tolerable, the editing is rather rudimentary and on top of that, the pacing becomes a bore sometimes. From the two main female characters, only Françoise Blanchard (as Catherine Valmont, the Living Dead Girl) manages to do a decent job. Her performance can easily be described as eerie, disturbing and captivating. Marina Pierro (as her life-long friend Hélène) on the other hand, fails to deliver. She comes off as uninspired and emotionless. During close-ups, it even looks like she's heavily drugged. Her gazing eyes made it look like she was on morphine during the entire shoot of the film. I might have gone a bit easier on the girl if she would've at least shown her voluptuous roundings unclothed, but she even failed to deliver that. The subplot with the foreign couple (both amateur-photographers in their roll, and poor actors in the movie too) doesn't even lead to anything. In fact, they're quite annoying: All they do is argue about everything up until the point you just wish they'd break up and disappear from the movie. Well, actually Them being in the movie does lead to something. While you might think that, with all their investigating, they will play a pivotal roll in the plot, all they accomplish in the end is getting themselves killed. Which leads us to the next thing this movie has to offer: The gore. Bloody gruesome activities happen on a regular base in LA MORTE VIVANTE. And while the blood-splattering, eye-popping, gut-munching, skull-splitting (by axe), throat-ripping (etc.) is all very enjoyable, the on-screen execution of the effects often leave a lot to be desired (i.e. you can see just a little too easy that it's all fake).  So, yes, there's not much in this movie that really works well. Except for the drama-part between the two girls (and that's a strange thing to say for a sleazy gore-flick). The relationship between the two of them, and how it evolves, is very interesting and keeps me from calling the movie over-all boring. It's intriguing how things change between them, even in such a manner that by the time the movie ends, the rolls of protagonist and antagonist have somewhat shifted. Catherine needs blood and kills, yes. But when the story progresses, she develops a severe aversion towards her actions. She becomes repulsed by them, so much even that she doesn't want to live (or should I say ""be undead"") anymore. Hélène, on the other hand starts providing her with fresh victims and near the end even starts killing anybody who comes too close to discovering their secret. So the drama between the girls is what almost makes this a good movie. That, and the ending. Now, I myself saw it coming even before the first act of the film was finished. The ending's predictability could be a big 'thumbs down' for the movie in general, but I must say I didn't feel all that negative about it. The execution of that final scene (starting from the events at the water, the shocking gore footage  for once looking realistic, Blanchard's performance, to the final frozen frame) is what saved the ending. And then the end-credits scroll the screen while a darkly ominous drone colours the soundtrack.   A solid ending to a rather weak movie featuring one of the most ridiculous opening-sequences ever in horror history (which I failed to mention earlier in this review)."
2,"This is a throwback. There was a time when horror films were gritty, exploitive, funny, nasty, and had moments so bad they were good. And boobs. They showed BOOBS! If you're not expecting Devil's Rejects or the Grudge or any other modern and slick horror, you will find Wedding Slashers watchable. ""Wedding Slashers"" is a direct descendant of those trashy, low budget 70s horror films. Catchy title, cute girls, nudity, blood, a big old knife on the artwork.   The movie opens with a flashback. A bride and a groom with not a nickel to rub together are heading to Vegas, running away from home to get married. They don't make it. They are exterminated by a gas mask, cloak wearing, Darth Vader sounding killer. He spouts some nonsense about love and then abruptly splits the brides head open like a watermelon. You practically see the seeds. Moving forward in time we meet another Bride. Every man she's every loved has died a mysterious death. Without ruining the end, the fate of her fiancé hangs in balance. Will the mystery be solved and will our love birds tie the knot before the bloody finale? The plot is simple. The performances are raw but more often than not, good. This production value is minimal, the technical aspects  besides a nice 5.1 surround mix, there are none. The gore is sometimes shocking, sometimes campy, and usually entertaining.  The charm in this is that a bunch of first timers (At least their previous credits don't add up to much) have made a little movie that pretty much works. You can see the missteps, but they are never boring or offensive. I would have liked to see more of the strippers at the bachelor party. Of course, it would have been nice to see more of the bride. There's a shower scene and for some reason, they don't show below her shoulders!! She's too cute to keep covered up. But despite those major drawbacks, Wedding Slashers is a keeper."
2,"Yes Boss is very good. Shah Rukh Khan was out of this world! He was fantastic as usual. Juhi Chawla was excellent! They both played their characters beautifully.  It's about Rahul (Shah Rukh Khan) who wants to be rich and have his own advertising agency. He works for Sidarth Chaudhry (Aditya Pancholi). He is married but is known to have lots of girlfriends. One day Rahul sees a pretty model in the agency, Seema (Juhi Chawla). Rahul finds it to be love at first sight but his boss gets there first. Seema doesn't know that Sidarth is married. They both love each other. Seema then finds out that Sidarth is married and Sidarth comes up with a plan to get her back. The plan is that he will make it seem as if his wife is having an affair and it works. Seema and Sidarth are back together. Seema spends time with Rahul and she gets to love him. Sidarth finds out and after a while Sidarth makes Rahul decide, being boss of the agency or Seema. Which will Rahul go for being boss or Seema? Watch Yes Boss to find out.  Yes Boss deserves a 9/10!"
0,"The old axiom that bored people are boring people is well demonstrated in ""Women in Love."" The script, taken from D. H. Lawrence's novel, contains an endless flow of concepts that are, at best, sophomoric.  What a pity so much effort went into so vacuous an exercise; what an empty array of characters given such attention. In spite of high production values, this film comes across as tedious as its personnel.  A revisit in 2001 merely confirms a 1969 impression of juvenille minds in adult bodies, dawdling nowhere, and fumbling every step of the way."
1,"I have always been keen on watching Hong Kong movies, but all of them failed to meet my expectations...until now! BURNING PARADISE doesn't contain the flat humor most HK movies have, nor a second rate story line that has been dragged into the film. The story is not complex, but there are never scenes that are just there to fill some ""intelligent"" space (the only truely intelligent martial arts film I have seen is CROUCHING TIGER, but since Hollywood is involved it is no true HK movie for me). There are some incredible fight scenes in this movie, from the first one(which is one of the coolest I have ever seen, yet so short) to the last main scenes! But mind, there's also a lot of blood that flows (people cut in half, decapitated, etc). The production is pretty good and the special effects show that the fantasy of the writer can be fulfilled even though some shots must be pretty technical (notice: the sheet of paper that he throws and got pinned into a wall!). Yep, it's not Tsui Hark or John Woo that made my favorite Hong Kong film, it's Ringo Lam! And I'm sure as hell going to check out more from this director! Ace."

1,"This films makes no pretentious efforts to hide its true genre -- a campy B movie. It will flat out tell you in the beginning the definition of campy. It should have also given the adjective meaning of cheese. But the two come together in this film in ways that make you go, ""Hmmmmm... that's so stupid!"" and then have you laughing. For example, there is a scene back in ""16th Century Japan"", which shows a couple of samurai walking in the foreground of a temple. In the background of the temple, there are several tourists looking off in the distance in slippers and shorts. Hmmmm... hahahah! I could not stop laughing. And the acting goes from decent, to bearable, to oh my Lord, but that's what makes it funny. You'll see some decent actors and then find others really terrible. I have to digress somewhat though because I have seen Stephanie Sanchez in several plays and she is awesome. Her air time in the film was pretty short though. I have also seen Bryan Yamasaki in several plays in the islands during my visits and he's also better in theatre than in this movie. Anyhow, it's an entertaining film, if you've got nothing to do on a weekday evening."
1,"Incredible documentary captured all the frenzied chaos and misery which loomed over NYC on that fateful morning of September 11th. Intense, personal, and completely riveting, 9/11 is perhaps the greatest documentary ever made by accident, which kind of gives it an even greater appeal. Up until that morning, filmmakers Gideon and Jules Naudet had been following around a New York firefighter team, concentrating specifically on one new recruit in a little piece they were shooting dealing with the rigorous training to become a fireman. Out with the team that morning filming yet another simple routine cleanup, Jules lifts his camera up to the sky just in time to record one of the only known images of the first plane hitting the World Trade Center, and from there a simple documentary was no more.  Viewers are given a first hand account of what it was like to be in and around ground zero, as the amazing group of fire-fighters and one profoundly bewildered cameraman attempt to navigate this disaster. Without hesitation, Naudet follows these automatically programmed heroes into the tower while it's entire support crumbles around them. The raw fear of an unknown, impending doom lurks with more viability then any fictional production could ever fathom as we watch less and less become audible and visible for those trapped inside. Nearly as memorable is older brother Gideon's candid capturing of an entire city in the throngs of a larger and more palpable fear then anything they had collectively witnessed. By the time we get to see the second tower collapse, as the cameraman shields himself from apocalyptic debris, we should all but be rinsing the dirt off ourselves from the amazingly up-close footage captured.  Obviously the filmmakers deserve only as much credit as being in the right place at the right time to document such an extraordinary event, though one can only admire the two brothers in their extraordinary adaptation to such an event; in a few desperate minutes we witness them become like the firemen they document- only instead of saving lives they knew they had to save footage, even if it cost them their own safety.  After viewing 9/11, and seeing that it came out in 2002, I feel much more resentment towards Oliver Stone's recent rendition, the big budgeted World Trade Center. Many had criticized the film for ignorantly narrowing down the focus to those two survivors trapped in rubble, and although I enjoyed the movie just fine for the small and sentimental Hollywood focus it brought, 9/11 all but renders his film completely obsolete. Not only will this utterly gripping footage remain the only definitive collection from that day, but the sublime transfer of motives midway ensures that this documentary has all the heart and character needed to never sensationalize the event again."
0,"This movie was a stupid piece of crap. Bad everything. Why is it that we who love western movies get jilted nine out of ten times when renting westerns. It seems that if you don't see names like Robert Duval, Kevin Kostner, or Tom Selleck attached to the cover, it isn't worth messing with. For the most part the main action of Shiloh Falls was taking place in 1892, yet the revolvers used were 1860s models. Even the shooting was bad - in one scene the Marshal fanned his six-shooter about nine times and couldn't hit any of three large men who were only about twenty feet away. I had to turn it off after about 15 minutes of this inanity. Perhaps those who participated in this movie could have taken some lessons at the Sunset Carson School of Acting."
0,"dont ever ever ever consider watching this sorry excuse for a film. the way it is shot, lit, acted etc. just doesn't make sense. it's all so bad it is difficult to watch. loads of clips are repeated beyond boredom. there seems to be no 'normal' person in the entire film and the existence of the 'outside world' is, well, it just doesn't exist. and why does that bald guy become invincible all of a sudden? this film is beyond stupidity. zero."
2,"If you think of the main villain as Elmer Fudd, this movie becomes much more funny.  So essentially, you have this small New Mexico town, where the local police department takes no notice of the fact that dozens of strippers from the local strip clubs vanish without a trace. In fact, the part of the movie that is about the one rogue cop who tries to catch the real killer is so irrelevant to the plot that I'm not even sure why they included it.  THe main part is about the hunter dude who decides that he would rather hunt strippers than deer. That is of course, after he rapes them. (Tastefully shown with a cut-away.)   The heroine of the movie is show as a innocent girl who is tricked into stripping and prostitution. Of course. We wouldn't feel any sympathy for her if she CHOSE to be a prostitute. She is stripped naked and forced to run from the crazy hunter who goes after her with a crossbow until she actually proves too resilient, and he switches to a long range hunting rifle. After running past enough strategically placed branches and cropped camera shots, she finds some clothes to finish the movie in.  Of course, the strip club in the movie is laughable. If the writer had spent any time in a real strip club, it might have increased the cost of this movie to a whole $61.00.  Not to say it wasn't totally without merit. There was some snappy dialog and some interesting scenes. But most of it was repetitive."
2,"Jodha-Akbar is a motley of exceptional love,Terrific Action,Soulful music and splendid cinematography.It is one of the most uncommon films and a must see one if you want to witness something special.The film got combative stunts and it has everything to please everyone.But on the other side,the film is slow and lengthy.The first half of the film lasts more than 2 hrs yet the twists and turns will glue the audience to the cinema.Hrithik was awesome as Akbar and Aishwarya was majestic as Jodha.Direction was at the best.Ashutosh proved yet another blockbuster which falls in the same line of Lagaan and Swades.May be he need to concentrate on the duration of the film by chopping off few scenes.Jodha Akbar is basically a love story instead of calling it as a War based film.The film lacks pace and slow narration of few scenes and the frequent usage of Urdu language made the audience ambiguous and also boring.But at the other end,even though the film lasts for more than 3.30 min,it is gripping enough and very much bearable.The Director need to edit the film and make it as a 3 hrs film so that the audience will like this film even more.The huge star-cast of Hrithik-Ash playing as Akbar and Jodha might have evoked a lot of curiosity among the audience before the release but i must admit the film almost lived up to the expectations.The love part was dealt exceptionally well and it is the forte for the film.The film depicted the Legacy of Akbar.The film also shown that Akbar did lot good for Hindus. I don't feel,the film will hurt any religion sentiments.The director did an excellent job in maintaining the balance.A R Rahman's background score was very good and music is freshy.And adding to that,the picturisation of the songs is spectacular.Especially Azeem-O-Shaanshahensha,it is definitely one of the best ever pictured songs in the history of Indian Cinema.Overall, a film worth watching."
1,"Unfortunately, the director Amos Guttman died from Aids-related illnesses the year after making this film, so we don't know how many more gay-related films we might have had from him. I found this used DVD, from Cinevista, on Amazon, but it looks like none of his other works are still available. Hessed Mufla (Amazing Grace) contains full frontal male nudity, at least in magazines, which turn into a wishful dream sequence. and some drug use. This is the story of two families getting by, or trying to, but the mothers, the daughters, and the gay sons all have their own problems to figure out. Jonathan (played by Gal Hoyberger) meets up with the next door neighbor Thomas, who has his own problems, of course. Either the translations are a little weak, or maybe Guttman kept the conversation sparse on purpose, for a little mystery. Watching this, I get the feeling we're not getting the whole story, but that's OK. Throw in a cute gay roommate ex-lover Miki (Aki Avni, who went on to do many projects, mostly Isreali TV) Lots of smoking. Lots of worrying by the mothers. A great blues song ""All Night Long Blues"" done by an unknown female artist; if she is listed in the credits,sadly it was not translated to English. Nice to see mothers and siblings treating gay relationships with respect, like any other relationship. But then, USA always has been years behind other countries in this way. A good way to spend 98 minutes... I wanted to see even more of it. Won awards at several film festivals, acc to IMDb and the film jacket."
2,"Yep - and one of My Favorite Comedies too, that seems to get better and better each time I catch it! That title year is 1954 and young TV comedy show writer (Linn-Baker) gets assigned as the chaperone to former, swinging, - and heavily drinking - swashbuckler movie star on the downfall (O'toole) for one wild weekend in NYC. Loving, glorious comedy nostalgia that is both a dreamy-eyed glance at old-time movie matinées & stardom as well as a smashingly production-detailed ode to those seemingly innocent, care-free days of the 1950's and its dawn of television.  Bullet-paced and aloof like a sitcom (or a Marx brothers movie), with nonstop parade of quotable lines and caricature-like characters that makes it ideal for multiple viewing... and a mystery why it seems SO overlooked and not rightly revered as one of the best comedies of the 1980's. The star of O'toole shines at its brightest, but down to the smallest role, it's cast to utter completion.... which makes me ask: what ever happened to Mark Linn-Baker and Joseph Bologna?  8 out of 10 from Ozjeppe"
2,"This is just an average John Ford film and he made a lot better movies than this one. This was made in the same year as The Grapes Of Wrath and it's hard to believe this was nominated for best picture. This movie has a great cast that stars John Wayne, Thomas Mitchell, Ward Bond and Barry Fitzgerald. This movie came out one year after Stagecoach, which made Wayne a star but he didn't become a big star until Red River eight years later. This is set in England during World War II and they are on a boat that is about to dock. Their really isn't a plot to the movie and it's just a bunch of little segments. It's just an OK Ford film but he made some better ones then this one."
2,"I love Sarah Michelle Gellar, she is capable of fantastic acting as made clear in the Buffy series. She has, unfortunately, been given no opportunities to show her considerable talent in film. While Cruel Intentions is a bad movie, Harvard Man is one of the worst - if not the worst - movie I have ever forced myself to sit through. The writing is practically non-existent. There are many scenes of back and forth dialogue with little purpose but to fill time. There are several simultaneous plots (gambling, drug addiction, sexual cheating, dealing with the mob), none of them interesting in their execution. There is no coherence - each plot thread seems forced in to fill time and is not interwoven with a big theme. One soon gets the feeling that the movie was started with little passion from the director, then finished in a hurry to meet a deadline. Harvard Man is transparently what it is: a quickly-made attempt to capitalize on Gellar's fame. To watch it is to wait for its end, amazed that such a thing actually made it as a major motion picture. I CAN'T believe the average rating here is close to 5. Anyone who says this movie is anything but awful is either mentally deficient or has an agenda. The only reason to watch this movie is to gawk at its atrociousness."
2,"I got into NCIS only during the past summer but I was so engrossed with the show that I watched it start to finish. It had a rocky start, sure, with the show trying to find its footing and its niche, but it figured out what it wanted to be fast and I find it to be FAR superior to its parent show, JAG. The plots, the characters, the cases, the everything, in this show, makes it great.  NCIS is the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, an actual organization, which investigates the homicides and crimes committed by or against members of the US Navy - i.e. naval civilian officers, navy officers and enlisted, and marine officers and enlisted. They're also very obscure, and hence are seen as the underdog of law enforcement(in the show, anyway) but, of course, as our heroes, they are brilliant. The main character, Leroy Jethro Gibbs, is a former gunnery sergeant Marine sniper with a murky and depressing past (like Bellisario likes to make his characters) and appears to have a consistent team of four characters: Abby Sciuto, the forensics expert, Anthony DiNozzo, the senior field agent, and Timothy McGee, the computer forensics expert and field agent who joined the show as a permanent member in season 2.  Earlier in the show, Kate Todd, played by Sasha Alexander, was also a member of the team and a former member of the Secret Service tasked with protecting the life of the president. Her character ended up being killed in one of the most brilliant story arcs I've seen on TV, and being replaced by Ziva David, a very unique character in terms of law enforcement drama, as she is a Mossad officer - i.e. her training is not investigation, but rather assassination and intelligence gathering.  The show has two very strong aspects to it which really make it stand out from the other generic shows of its kind like CSI. Firstly, the characters are, while somewhat stereotypical in their mold, fully developed and incredibly dynamic. Tony is perhaps the best example of this - when the show started he was a goofy, slightly moronic field agent, and he developed into the professional, trained officer who keeps his sense of humor in check or uses it to his advantage. Relationships between the characters changed dramatically, with Ziva and Tony starting out as small friends and quickly graduating to huge amounts of romantic tension - which of course ends up playing a massive role in the 6th season and ultimately brings the events to their culmination. The second aspect of the show that really makes it unique to me is both the creativity of the individual cases and the amazing nature of the story arcs. The La Grenouille story arc was absolutely brilliant and I could not have foreseen it, and the introduction of Ari and Michael were equally fascinating. In addition to that, the show is not afraid to make some bold choices (for those who have seen the season 2 finale, they know what I'm talking about). Characters can go and come and even with the main ones, there's no certainty. It's the mark of a good television show.  The dark horse of the show, Dr. Mallard, played by famous Scottish actor David McCallum, is probably the most intriguing of these characters. As a body forensics expert he has a strange past that he loves to share but personally, as a medical student, I found the accuracy of his character's work to be fascinating. The autopsy scenes, while grisly, fascinate me because they're quite accurate in their depiction and their protocol.  This show is worth seeing and is a family show; I think it can be watched by more than one generation at a time and is thoroughly enjoyable. 9/10"
1,"I don't believe this was an acting challenge for Richard Harris. This was an uncomplicated plot, yet interesting. It is a good movie to watch when you don't want to do a lot of thinking, just want to be told a simple story. The Canadian scenery was breathtaking. The beautiful Fall shots alone made the picture worth seeing."
2,"I really have a hard time believing that ANYONE enjoyed this movie. This movie could have been so great. It could have been amazing. It could have been the best Terminator yet. But it wasn't. It wasn't even close. The story was terrible. There wasn't enough action. This was supposed to be a war, but there were no full scale war scenes. Christian Bale was just as stiff as John Conner as he was as Batman (cheesy voice, no personality).  The movie did start okay. I thought it might go in a good direction, but then stupid things started happening. First of all they spent the first hour of the movie acting like Marcus is a person just to have the major revelation that he is actually a machine - but wait, we already knew that from all of the trailers out there, so we just spend the first hour of the movie saying to ourselves ""why are they still acting like he's human""???? Then we do actually have a good action scene with the large terminators and the motorcycle terminators, but then another stupid thing happens. When Marcus is captured and Blair breaks him out, the entire resistance can't even catch him or kill him in their own home base!!! How could they possibly win a war against the machines when they can't even kill one in their own home???? It keeps going down from there. John conner sneaks in to the Skynet home base (very easily). Then there is a terribly boring fight scene that I swear they copied directly from the first two films. Then John plants a detonator on the pile of nuclear power cells that just happened to be sitting around and on his way out he blows the whole place up. If it were really that easy to walk in to Skynet and blow up a pile of power cells, why didn't they do that years ago. TERRIBLE.  And just when I thought the movie couldn't possibly get any worse... it does. John injured his heart reenacting the fight scene from the first Terminator movie, so Marcus (the machine with a heart) gives John his heart. Awwww, what a sacrifice. I guess Marcus really was human. TERRIBLE.  And then they had the nerve to end the stupid movie with John giving one of his terrible speeches leading right into the next movie. I really really really hope that if they do make another movie that someone else writes it, stars in it, produces it, and directs it.  If this weren't a Terminator movie, I would have given it 3 stars for being so bad, but since it destroyed so much potential I couldn't give it any more that 1 star. TERRIBLE. I'm totally disappointed."
1,"...dont read any plot summaries because in words the plot might seem trivial, brain-dead and pointless. The film is excellent, the acting by both Denzel and Dakota (she will go sky high, trust me on that)are just fabulous, and the plot is mind blowing. Actually ""fabulous"" is a small word to use for such talented actors. The film is just based on actual facts and some characters are not fictional, a fact that adds up to the shock that i was having during and after the film. If you are fond of both actors and of somewhat deranged films, you still haven't watched your favorite one yet...Trust me, in the end you will have a weird and inexplicable feeling. The film is awesome, see it, rent it, buy it or whatever...just don't miss it"
2,"Apart from Dicaprio's performance this film was so awful. Its up there with Honey and Cheaper by the Dozen. If you are thinking of watching this film please don't, its simply awful. Its melodramatic and the script is messy and unrealistic. Why would Dicaprio become a junkie all of a sudden? At first he was a bit of solvent sniffer and then just hours after trying a bit of coke he is raiding a medicine cabinet just to get high. I'm sorry but addiction is a gradual progress. It doesn't come out consuming a few lines of cocaine to aid sexual performance. Waste of time. What is sad that this could've been a decent film. Bloody crap"
0,"I began watching this movie with low expectations, as a matter of fact i only noticed it because it was an adaptation of a S.K. novel ( a novel i never read).  I'm glad my expectations were low because the movie wasn't nothing close to good, but it manages to keep you interested. What really drags this story down is the work done by the director and the actors. The movie is overlong, hasn't no ""nice"" shots and no scares, the dialogs are dumb and the special effects are crap.  The only things good are that, as i said, it keeps you interested ( i guess the book must be good) without using much horror cliches.  My Vote 4/10."
2,"I am a big fan of Gregg Araki's movies especially the trilogy this movie is a part of. My friends and I have even assembled our own little cult following for it. It is for sure a twisted and perverse movie but at the same time it has a message and funny all at the same time. I would only recommend this if you are into shocking, graphic commentary on our society and can stomach violence and sexual deviance. Now since the waring is out of the way I want to say i think this movie is genius and i love the WTF? feeling you get after watching this and the other two movie in this series (Nowhere and Totally F***ed Up). If you do watch this movie and don't like it the first time I suggest you watch it again, i promise after the initial shock you will see the art behind it all."
2,"An underrated time dislocation episode about an aging stage actor (Brian Aherne) in an unhappy second marriage to a much younger floozey who finds himself extremely nostalgic about his past. His travel back to the past takes unexpected turns, and makes a sharp lesson for him and the viewer. The twenties are stylishly and movingly evoked, with Pippa Scott making one fantastic flapper. An extremely young Sydney Pollack shows up in the present, playing an obnoxious director (there's a stretch!). But the show is Aherne's and he does a wonderful job with it, reminding us of the quality actors this series attracted. Nothing horrifying or scary, but it's one that sticks with you."
2,"As a lover of horror films, and a particularly keen fan of werewolves, even I found this film to be a total piece of crap. Not even slightly scary. I have never been less scared while watching a ""horror"" film than this. Seriously, Ghostbusters seems like The Exorcist compared to this load of tripe. And Julian sands has got to be the worst bad guy ever. I reckon he's just reading lines off a prompter; that's what it actually sounds like. The only good thing about this film was seeing Elsa Patasky's breasts, everything else was totally shite.It is even more of a shame because the idea has potential. Based on a real life, self confessed ""werewolf"" (well, a dude suffering from lycanthropy), Romasanta had the potential to be seriously creepy, especially with the dark forests of the area and the quaint little villages so horribly afraid of a big bad wolf. Total waste of time. And coming from me, this movie must be poor -I like pretty much every piece of crap ever made."
2,"There is really nothing with which to compare this episodic series. The pacing, the acting, and the plots blend to create a superb fictional experience. I find very, very little to like in today's movies (No Country for Old Men being an exception) and much more to like on television, which I understand his heresy to some, but Six Feet Under, Doctor Findlay, Morse, Midsomer Murders, The Shield etc. far surpass any movie I've seen in a long time. This show in particular shows what can be done in cinema but not in writing--very, very unique. Seeing Foyle, his driver and his immediate subordinate act their parts really helps make this a fine viewing experience. Kitchen, playing the lead, is a fine actor and performs admirably, but the writing is what makes this show--Horowitz, the writer and creator, never varies from show to show. He controls the unfolding of this show, without the viewer having to worry about different writers muddling the waters. I highly recommend this show and would urge viewers to watch the series sequentially, starting, of course with the first episode."
0,"Unless you understand wretched excess this movie won't really mean much to you. An attempt was made to interject a bit of humanity into a cold and bleak period consumed by alcohol and drugs -- it doesn't work.  When Salma Hayak does her big disco number her voice is so obviously dubbed it is pathetic -- the producers could at least have gotten someone that sounded remotely like her.  The documentary that has been playing on television lately is far superior and gives a much truer view of that period of our history.  No one, with the exception of Mikey Myers, could be accused of acting; however, he does an incredible job."
2,"compared to the TV series,this thing is crap.i couldn't get through it,i was so bored.it's just not exciting.there's no real suspense or excitement,at least up to the point i watched.that's really surprising,given the quality of the series.it takes place after season six,and before season seven,so i guess it's a season seven prequel.if you can get through it,i would recommend it,as it does fill in some gaps between the sixth and seventh season.i only know this,because in some scenes they allude to events that must have happened in the movie.for me,though it was just too difficult to get through.my vote for 24:Redemption is a 4/10"
0,I have been reading the reviews for this movie and now I wanna kill my self. I don't wanna live in a world where people find this move or Rob Schneider funny. What is wrong with these people. I'm not angry at Rob Schneider because he has the intelligence of a dead cat. I watched this film in disbelief. Who would pay money to make this?? This film is so bad that its painful. Most bad films are funny because they are crap. The Animal is just DISGUSTING!!! Watch this film and if you like please for all of man kind kill your self. We don't need you. I want to raise money to get Rob Scheider off all movies. If someone killed Rob Schneider they should be given a Nobel peace prize.
2,"OK, so it's not Oscar winning material, but I don't think it was meant to be. ""Highway to Hell"" is a fun flick about a couple on their way to Las Vegas to get married. They are eloping and to steer clear of the ""authorities"", they take a back road that turns into an entrance to hell. Yeah, it's corny but it's very entertaining and very well done.  For the most part the acting is very good and the production including scenery and music are top notch. I loved the fact that ""Hitler"" is played by Gilbert Gottfried! Anne Meara, Ben Stiller, and the lovable Richard Farnsworth are also in the film as well as the late Kevin Peter Hall. As always, Chad Lowe does an A+ performance as ""Charlie"". I loved ""Hell Cop"" too. This is a fun movie! (I have not watched this film in over 10 years but I still enjoy remembering it.)  This is another film that should be available on DVD. The purchase information shows the VHS tape available in Canada, but it really isn't (out of print). The movie industry would make more money if these old films were made available. There are lots of films I would love to have in my personal collection. This is definitely one of them!"
2,"My cousin rented this movie when he was staying over one night. This movie is a howler. The acting, budget and fight scenes are bad. My father had a hoot making all of us laugh with his witty observations. Come to think of it, this makes a great party movie. Bad acting, sloppy direction and lame chop socky= Great party movie.  Recommended for party viewing. Those brave enough to view it alone will truly be dissapointed.  C  Another hit or miss, a case of hit or miss... -The Damned"
2,"Hurray for Hollywood. The same (or at least same type) anti-war, pseudo intellectual morons who attempted to BRAND Vietnam veterans with the Hollywood lies. The same smears, from those who have never served their country, in an attempt to discredit the only heroes we have left, the American Serviceman.  Facts exist, studies have been made, papers have been written, and the facts are in re those who served in Vietnam compared to study groups comprised of those who served in the military, but not in Vietnam and groups of ""civilians"" that found ways to avoid military service. The Vietnam vet is better adjusted, less mental illness, healthier, wealthier, more productive, and less likely to act like a total butt wipe than the latter groups. The information is available to those that care to know the facts rather than to follow the California nutcases. When studies are made re the veterans of the Middle East and/or Afghanistan, the result will probably be the same.  The American fighting men and women are not dopers, drunks, sadistic baby killing, dog drowning, prisoner torturing retards. No doubt some few go over the line. However if anyone has a question about that, who has never served anything but their own self-interest. they have not earned the right to either ask the question and do not deserve an answer.  Tommy Lee Jones as the grieving father (not an retired officer by the way.. he played a retired sergeant)is as always EXCELLENT... Susan Sarandon as always is not believable... and Charlize Theron is Terrific, as always.. Those playing the friends of Jones's deceased son are typical smarmy Hollywood types, trying to look like soldiers but would probably be better cast in movies like Broke Back Mountain.. I was impressed with Francis Fisher's parts.. no silicon there.  Anyway the movies overall is pretty good, but then some halfwit has to come up with idea of the flying the US flag upside down to show what they think of this country...That ticked me off..  You know these are the same people that live in 30,000 square foot houses with a garage full of gas guzzling cars, a few airplanes, and helicopters, tour buses, Olympic size pools, who think nothing of spending $1000 bucks for a meal they do not eat... and then campaign to get the poor smucks who make %50,000 or less a year to conserve, etc.  The Hollywood morons... they are so out of touch with reality that it is disgusting.... Maybe McCarthy was right and they are all Un-American, communist illegitimate sons of......... well, you know."
2,"Sometimes it's as if we can forgive the most trying stretches of believability, just because a film was made in an era like the 50's with a shoestring budget. I don't like that. Good, believable films were made at this time as well as clinkers. This has some things going for it, but the way these nasty characters behave is beyond imagination. They wave their guns around, threaten, but don't seem to want to act. Hostages are left to wander all over the place. There is tension among the thieves, but it is dealt with in such a silly, haphazard way, it doesn't work. A slip up of any kind, and their whole project is down the chute. If we are to believe the whole business about being locked up in the woods in the winter, it seems at some point, someone would begin to make realistic plans to get on their way. Are they already murderers? I don't know, but they could have certainly done a better job of getting on with their plot. Then there is the ending (I'm not going to do any spoilers). This is the most ho-hum, contrived mess I've ever seen. It's as if they ran out of time and just decided to create this ending. Judge for yourself. The bottom line is, people just don't act this way--they just don't."
2,"Black Robe (1991)   Released with poor timing in the aftermath of a similar themed film - Kevin Costner's Dances with Wolves - Black Robe largely got lost in the shuffle. That's a shame, because the film is actually quite remarkable. Not to say that it hasn't had influence on other films however. Black Robe certainly must have had quite an influence on Terrence Malick and his The New World. The title credits are clearly inspired by those in Black Robe, and other aspects are familiar as well.  Set in 17th century Quebec, the film follows a young Jesuit priest, Father Lafourgue (Bluteau), referred to as Black Robe by the natives. He travels with a band Algonquins lead by Chomina (Schellenberg). With Father Lafourgue is Daniel, a young Frenchman, who is in love with Chomina's daughter. The young priest soon begins to inspire fears that he is some sort of demon, and many in the band wish to leave him behind, or possibly even kill him and his companion.  Their travels meet turmoil among other hostile native tribes, leading not only a struggle between peoples, but a struggle between faiths. Beresford creates a very bleak atmosphere, using the cold Quebec landscape as an intimidating, but still beautiful backdrop. The weather feels cold, the air crisp. It's really quite a beautiful film to look at.  Bruce Moore, who wrote the screenplay and the novel it was based on, went to great lengths in research to accurately portray this period in time. Many have praised the film for its accuracies, while a number of others have however complained that it shows natives as savages. I have to disagree. Neither side is shown as total bad guys, nor total good guys. The film gives everyone a fair shake. Both sides have/had their reasons, and both sides committed terrible acts. Certainly, not all Natives were all about peace and love, which is not a slight to them in the least. Their history is a noble one, and they had every right to fear and be hostile in the face of Europeans. That said, I'm probably overcompensating for the film, because it really doesn't show Natives as savages at all, especially not the Algonquins. Moore claimed, in fact, that he actually toned down the violence of the Natives compared to what he found in his research. That said, what he found in his research was most likely overstated to begin with.  Black Robe certainly is a bleak picture. The naturalistic photography and tone adds to the depressed atmosphere. This is not a story of joys, but of sorrows. When the film ends, we are told what history has already told us - the Natives were slaughtered and the Jesuit's mission by and large was a futile failure.  Though the film sticks to its own dark history, this is more than just a very well done history lesson. Black Robe is a parable of the horrifying results that come from misunderstanding, miscommunication, and ignorance. While the Jesuit mission was well intentioned, it was more a product of Eurocentric ignorance than anything else. The Native people had their own religious beliefs, and the film shows that. The lessons in Black Robe are transferable to any number of modern day conflicts. We have not learned our lesson, and by removing the gloss and glamour off the period epics of old, Black Robe serves as a reminder. Such a shame its so overlooked."
2,"I like flying movies, but being a professional pilot, I have found misleading info about Earhart, that was probably more the fault of her sponsors than herself However, she did not shy from the limelight, and was an ardent feminist.  This made for TV film appears to be a little short on facts and long on the myths that have made Earhart the most famous of female pilots. This mythology is not fair to other aviators,male and female, who made more contributions to aviation as a commercial venture and towards safety.  This film thus centers on the myth, rather than stick to the facts. Earharts aviation contributions are substantial, however, she seemed to have more than her share of accidents, some of which indicate a basic failure of pilot judgment. Engines can fail, weather is unpredictable, gas may be exhausted before landing, but a pilot's judgment must be constant to meet the various challenges.  The real Earhart apparently had so many irons in the fire, her skills as a pilot became questionable. One of a pilot's requirements is recent experience. Making historical flights in questionable aircraft could not be a part-time job. In a recent biography of Earhart, none of her warts which would show her humanity rather than the public image which we already know. This film does nothing for me but watching aircraft fly."
2,"I actually found this DVD in supermarket basket full of discount products. 3,50 is not much, especially when it's says: The most funniest comedy since ""There's something about Mary"" starring: Ben Stiller, Janeane Garofalo, Mike Meyers, Alanna Ubach and many others... Alanna Ubach is the hot number from ""Meet the Fockers"" and Janeane Garofalo (which i personally like as well) known for her work with Ben Stiller on ""Reality Bites"", ""Mystery Men"" and lot's of other projects. So i rushed to the counter to make this disc (full of visual moments of adventure) all mine.   I honestly did expected much more from the storyline, i couldn't watch it in one time, it's getting so boring so i took couple of days of interval before i finished the movie. Sorry, but in such cases i rather read something in between. But at the same time if they had more money on this project. They probably did much better job than the final result. Sound and visual shout for improvement. Crap movies like ""The whole 9 yards"" for example, had much, much more financial backup so they get more attention and credit.   I would say, nice try, they did it because they have guts, less afraid to fail. Bruce Willis started with ""The Moonlightning"" as well. Look at him, he managed to survive that and he's big boy now. But retail price 3,50 is exact wright amount to ask for, no one deserve to get reach on this movie. This is kind of a student-introduction movie and not like: Hey, give me your wallet!"
1,"Whenever I see most reviews it's called 'a misfire for Eddie Murphy'. These critics want to take a look at some of the stuff he's doing these days, and maybe soften their stance in retrospect... ""The Golden Child"" is not highbrow entertainment, but thanks to some of the cast it breaths new life into old clichés, and gives Murphy one of his best roles. I don't understand the pervading lack of 'love' for its efforts, at all. Perhaps it was released at a time when the establishment had grown weary of knockabout, thrill-a-minute adventures? Steven Spielberg started it with Indiana Jones; it's unfair to make this one a scapegoat when what is possibly its biggest sin is also utterly harmless. There's nothing necessarily wrong with trying to capitalise on trends.  Yes it's silly, but even an occasional observer should be able to understand that 'ridiculous' is where Hollywood's idea of mysticism begins and ends. What's more important than believability with a story like this is that the audience have entertaining tour guides on hand to show them the mysterious sights. Michael Ritchie and Eddie Murphy fit the bill for this capacity just fine. My advice to you is to buy the ticket and take the ride."
2,"This movie had a little of everything, humor, relationships, and more. I would recommend this movie to anyone"
2,"My roommate and I rented three movies and this was one of them...We should have saved it for last so that we could watch something funny before we went to bed. It was the funniest thing I've seen in a long time.  What was the director thinking? This story has been done over and over and over again. And what's with the jumping around so much? It's annoying and...just plain annoying! AND they left room for sequel! WHY?  I think my roommate and I are going to throw it out the window. Or maybe we'll just play Frisbee with it. I haven't decided yet. Either way, I'll get some entertainment out of it.  Funniest ""scary"" movie ever."
2,"Am I the only person in the world who does not find Dinner for One in the least funny? The sketch belongs to a low, unsubtle type of slapstick, something that may appeal to some non-Anglosaxon audiences. A world apart from the best of subtle humor (as in Yes Minister), or the best of slapstick for that matter (as in Laurel and Hardy movies). Even if some of the incidents could be regarded as comical (for example, the butler's frequent collisions with a tiger's head on the floor), their very repetitiousness engenders tedium. All the 'comical' bits are contained in the first three minutes, after which they are repeated ad nauseam. Mocking the frailties of old age seems unworthy to me. The success of Dinner for One remains a mystery."
2,"The idea is interesting, and it's refreshing that people from future are in game, and not aliens again. And also, music, title sequence and effects are very well done.  But story is not believable and neither is acting.  I can't believe how unrealistic and incompetent American government and her officials are displayed. Well, except the part about acting all morally righteous, especially with people from other countries (Rwanda).  It's a shame, because this could have been a great SF.  Have you noticed advertisement?"
0,"I thought this movie was terrible. I'm Chinese, so I thought everything was totally wrong. Many of the facts were incorrect. The only thing right about Chinese history in the movie was when Wendy's mother explained to her husband about the statues that guarded ShiHuangDi. I also thought the fight scenes were very cheesy and fake. Many of the actors and actresses were not very great. Some of the jokes that were supposedly ""funny"" were really stupid. I think this movie should receive the worst possible rating it could get. Disney has really got to get more information about Chinese history if they want to create an extravagant movie. Mulan was quite accurate. Watch this movie if you want to waste some time."
1,"I saw this film and heard the writer-director, Juan Gerard, speak at the Santa Barbara Int'l Film Festival.  All I knew about it was that it was the story of an 8-year-old boy at the time of the Cuban Revolution in 1958 and how it affects his home and family.  Its opening scene will bring to mind ""Cinema Paradiso"". In fact, the film is filled with references to classic films: The Roulette Wheel (Casablanca), ""chicken clucking"" (Rebel Without a Cause), references to Bunuel, ""Touch of Evil""; you'll find more. The homeless man (Georg Stanford Brown)is a reference to Cuban folklore which often uses a black man as a type of Greek chorus.  What this film really is is the culmination of a dream. Gerard's wish to honor his family and medium of film that he has loved all of his life.  This is the true story of Juan Gerard and all the people in it are real,as are the events depicted. Gerard is actually an architect and engineer (and passionate film lover) but his dream was to make this movie. He and his wife decided to live that dream and Harvey Keitel became an ""angel"" who believed in Gerard and agreed to produce and star in it. Keitel holds the screen powerfully as the mysterious and secretive grandfather ""Che"". Brown and Keitel are the only Americans in the cast. Iben Hjejle (High Fidelity) and Gael Garcia Bernal (Y tu Mama Tambien) offer strong support in key roles.  Truthfully, the first half of the film suffers from stiff delivery of lines, and some overracting, but stay with it. The last half is much better as the events of the revolution combine for the bittersweet, and honest climax. It is the first effort of Juan Gerard, but it is honest as he is and his passion and heart really come through,in this sincere first effort. I would definitely see it again, and hope that he continues his film career.  "
2,"Cast of giants appears in this ridiculous mixture of the Exorcist, Godzilla, Little Big Man, and Leprechaun. There is nothing good in the movie at all, except that it is so stinking bad. The greasy little monster that crawls out of Susan Strasberg's back is a powerful shrimp (shrunken and disfigured because of the multiple X-Rays done when trying to figure out what was going on with this goiter gone bad). This evil manitou means to destroy the world. It is a native American Monster, and therefore, only a Native American medicine man can stop it. Chief Bromden from ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is willing to take on the challenge.   I saw this movie with a friend of mine about 20 years ago and we still laugh about it. I also saw ""Ordinary People"" about the same time. It won the academy award for best picture and is a good movie. I can hardly remember the movie now.  There is a place for bad movies. I give this a ranking of 2 out of ten because of the fact that it offers a lot of unintentional laughs. Otherwise it would definitely be a zero. It's not ""Plan Nine From Outer Space,"" or ""Robot Monster,"" but it isn't bad for a horrible, but memorable poor flick.  "
2,"I managed to catch this three and a half hour (plus) made for TV movie in the wee hours of the morning on Lifetime Movie Network and I didn't even fall asleep! It featured a number of Australian actors (that happens when you film the movie in Australia) but there were a few recognizable actors, such as Antonio ""Hubba Hubba"" Sabato Jr. and Joanna Cassidy. I've always liked Joanna Cassidy; she is a quality actress and she doesn't disappoint in this one.  The plot is your typical ""stranded on a deserted island"" theme, except this island is loaded with booby traps left over by the Japanese in WWII. That was a nice little plot twist except that one can predict who's going to make it off the island and who's not. Well, at least I could predict it. I also had visions of Gilligan's Island dancing in my head when (according to the story) the rag-tag group managed to build very livable huts (with doors and beds no less) after just 3 weeks on the island! Wow, the professor would have been proud! One has to wonder why they spent those first 3 weeks building those wonderful living quarters instead of a raft which they could have used to get OFF the island, but hey, then the movie couldn't have lasted as long as it did. Some of the characters are also reminiscent of the Gilligan's Island castaways such as the character of Lucille, who starts out as a snotty yet beautiful Ginger-type then turns into a fledgling Samurai under the hallucinogenic tutelage of a dead Japanese soldier because she just happens to be fluent in Japanese (as well as Vietnamese) and managed to translate the dead soldier's diary. Talk about luck!  Plot holes aside, I liked this movie. The acting was good, the story wasn't bad (a little predictable) and if you ever have the chance to view it I would recommend it."
1,"Randolph Scott is heading into Albuquerque to take a job with his uncle. However, on the way there, the stage is held up--even though they are not carrying a strongbox. However, a nice lady on board is concealing $10,000 for her and her brother's business...and the robbers seem to know this.  Once in town, Scott goes to this uncle about the job. However, he soon learns that this uncle is a jerk--the typical bad guy from Westerns. You know, the rich guy who only wants to become richer by cheating and stealing and threatening until he owns everything. And, it just so happens that this jerk was behind the robbery. Scott demands that the uncle returns the money and then Scott goes into business with the nice lady and her brother.  Not surprisingly, this is NOT the end of the problems---just the beginning. Again and again, intrigues of various types occur to try to crush the uncle's opposition. One trick is to bring in a pretty lady to befriend Scott and his partners. She's a crack shot and it looks bad for Scott--until he figures out why she's come to town.  Unlike most later Randolph Scott films, this one shows Scott as a bit more headstrong man. All too often in his films he's the last one to suggest violence, but in this film he's quick to suggest a lynching (screw the law, let's have a hangin') and later he's quick to threaten the uncle. What a surprise to see him as such a hot-head--though in most other ways, he's the same old Scott you'd expect.  As far as the film goes, there's nothing particularly unusual about it. Gabby Hayes plays the usual character, Scott is a hero, the baddie cannot be reasoned with and ultimately is destroyed and Scott gets the girl. Despite this very typical plot, it's all handled very well and as a result is well worth your time.  By the way, there are two weird scenes in the film. First, late in the movie, there is a fist fight between Scott and the uncle's #1 henchman, Lon Chaney, Jr.. In it, Chaney smokes as he fights--something I never saw before and I did admire how he could puff away as he got his butt kicked. Second, get a load of that runaway cart scene with the whip--now THAT was one impossible feat!"
2,"I bought this movie uncut because I love gory movies. Everyone had hyped this movie so much and talked about how gory it was. The only death scenes I saw were a few long, drawn out gut-munching scenes, very repetitive and boring. I can only watch a few zombie hands reaching into a cadaver and pulling out pig intestines and fake blood so many times before it gets really old. Not to mention the few other scenes where people died were equally mundane. A woman gets her face pulled through some jagged glass in a scene that pathetically attempts to re-create the eye-piercing scene from Fulci's Zombie. Someone gets decapitated and...aw who cares. Even the guy who has the first confrontation with the zombies looks like he is maybe going to have something cool happen, the zombie has his hands wrapped around the guy's face, does he crush his head, gouge his eyes, try to eat his brain? No! He lets him go! What the he!!? The plot was terrible, the gore was redundant and the special effects were sub-par. How dare anyone try to compare this with the other Italian zombie films at the time."
2,"A group of 20-somethings have regular Role Playing Game gatherings at their former high school teacher's house. John, the geekiest of them all, gets picked-on by some of the other ""gamers."" He kills himself and the others find themselves being stalked by a knight on horseback. Yeah. This movie is quite possibly the worst film I've ever seen. I've always thought obsessive ""gamers"" (I cringe at that word!) were somewhat off, but this movie just makes them look incredibly stupid when playing their RPG. I can usually find some redeeming value in any movie, no matter how bad, but that is not the case with ""Knight Chills."" My Rating: 0/10."
2,Loathsome is the only word I can use to describe this aberration to an already weak series of films.  At best the Sleepaway Camp series has always been something of a guilty pleasure amongst horror film fans. This iteration not only undermines the silly B-movie cheese that fans have come to expect from the series but it also manages to create an incredibly unlikable cast of losers that you can't cheer for or care about.  Fan's of eighties slasher films should note that the gore here is weak at best. There is no nudity and the cast is made up of unlikable miscreants. The plot (if you can even call it that) leads to a completely out of left field ending that adds up to a miserable filmgoing experience all around.  Ignore this one like it never happened and you'll be better off.
0,"In one word: excruciating. I was advised to read some articles about this film's philosophical meanings afterward, but, having sat through the movie's interminable 115 minutes and being slowly crushed beneath its bloated symbolism and lava-flowing oppressiveness, it seemed better to just report my reactions to the movie. After all, who goes to see a movie with a syllabus in hand? And this flick was dismal. Lead actor Claude Laydu, from the film's opening to its end, wears the same wearying and annoying mask of agony as to be practically indistinguishable from the film's eternal, dreary voice-over. Filming one over the other might have worked better than subjecting an audience to both, as they basically say the same thing: The priest of Ambricourt is a wretched human being. The story, about a persecuted priest who tries to help out a troubled rich family, does nothing toward making its characters remotely interesting or sympathetic, as the family are a bunch of unpleasant weirdos, and the priest, himself, comes across as a nosy pest. The last 30 minutes suggests some breath-taking message about grace and one man's suffering equaling that of others, but due to all the indulgent close-ups of a suffering Laydu and the vague subtext in Robert Bresson's script, all I felt was, Finally, it's over, let's have some ice-cream. Interesting for fans of Bresson fanatic Paul Schrader, just to see how many elements of character and setting Schrader carried into in his own scripts and movies, especially ""Taxidriver"", ""Raging Bull"" and ""Light Sleeper""."
0,"This movie is a cringe-fest of bad acting and poor set design as well as tacky lines and a lame plot. But it is so much fun to watch. Everything about it is hilarious.The basic plot is a group of scientists from the future travel back in time to capture their evil co-worker who is intent on destroying them all. They catch up with him in the year 1146. The 'futuristic' lab of the scientists from the year 2033 is an eighties-style room with a bunch of 'futuristic' flashing buttons and a time capsule that looks like a lawn shed. The actors deliver their lines with unenthusiastic aplomb, which isn't hard to understand considering that the lines are usually earth-shakers like "" I double-checked everything twice!"" He double checked everything twice? He checked it four times? Not only that, but they feed you the entire premise of the movie in the first five minutes, and continue at a rapid fire pace until they hit the medieval part. When Roger Corman ran out of money. And had to stop travelling through time and consequently different sets. The medieval set is a comic mish-mash of anything from the late 10th century to the 16th century. Any costume they could find, they used. I guess chain mail wasn't on the budget, 'cause the guys all wear sequined shirts masquerading as armor. The fight scenes are laughable, with men casually throwing themselves onto cardboard swords with abandon and dying in death throws with nary a blow cast.It sounds truly awful, but I enjoy it every time I watch it. The lines alone are enough to have you in fits and everything else pulls together to create a fabulous B-movie that, if you are a connoisseur of corny flicks, I would suggest you see. And once you have, read the review on Unknown Movies. I love hearing them point out all the funny, truly awful bits in the movie."
1,"When I saw the Exterminators of year 3000 at first time, I had no expectations for that movie. Although, it wasn't so bad as I was thought. It's kind of Italian version of Roadwarrior, with cast, that is almost famous in Italy, including Venantino Venantini. Behind the story is Elisa Briganti and Dardano Sacchetti, who are also responsible for story of Zombie flesh-eaters. You can also see other links to Italian horror movies: Luca Venantini plays the role of Tommy, and you can see that kid in Paura nella citta dei morti viventi (City of the living dead AKA Gates of hell) as John Robbins and in Cannibal apocalypse as the role of Mary's brother. Quite entertaining movie, with some dull parts."
2,"Until recently I had never heard of this film. After seeing some reviews on Amazon.com, I had to see it. Well, all I can say is why isn't this film known as a classic Christmas film like Miracle on 34th Street. What a delightful movie! This is perfect family fare- This is the kind of movie I only wish they would make today. Jimmy Durante is as usual the lovable looser! He is perfect for the role of Terry Moore's father. The original title of this film was 'The Great Rupert', Rupert being a magical squirrel  The use of a puppet type squirrel was very innovative in 1950, but of course is very campy by today's standards. It would be interesting to see what they could do with today's technology. All in all this is a fun family film that is a must for all to see- Now that it is available on DVD maybe more people will get the opportunity to see it. If you have not yet gone over to DVD, be aware that this film is also available on VHS. Take a chance; I think you will enjoy it!"
2,"Comment #121  Time travel has always fascinated us. For generations people have wanted to know what it would be like to go ahead in time, and especially backward. In the Final Countdown, you and the characters are taken back in time not just to any place, but to the time of one of the most important days in America's history.  The U.S.S. Nimitz is a nuclear aircraft carrier in 1980 that is stationed in Pearl Harbor. It is pulled into a supernatural time warp that sends it to the same place, but 39 years earlier. That's right, Pearl Harbor in 1941, and the morning of December 6, in fact. When the crew of the Nimitz realizes where they are, they must decide if they want to change the fate of the people there on that morning as well as American history.  The cast overall is enjoyable to watch, but not perfect. Martin Sheen is great as Warren Lasky, a guest on the Nimitz on the day the time warp takes it away. Kirk Douglas is also worthy of recognition as Captain Matthew Yelland, the captain of the Nimitz. However, Charles Durning as Senator Samuel Chapman can get annoying, not because of Durning, but because his character complains almost the whole time he is on-screen. Also, it's kind of easy to notice that some of the crew members of the Nimitz are actual sailors, not actors by the way they deliver their lines.  The flying scenes and visual effects in the movie were a lot of fun, especially when Nimitz crewmembers encounter Pearl Harbor-era Japanese Zero scout planes. The score by Alan Howarth and John Scott was pretty good, and the sounds of the planes and ships were well-done as well.  The Final Countdown is a great movie, but not perfect. For anyone looking for a movie that gets your imagination and your adrenaline going, The Final Countdown is the right choice.  8/10"
2,"I can't believe people - married/single/in significant relationships could not relate to this show!! This is the real deal with a couple sparklers in hand to make it shine. As much as us 'women' would hate to think we had a 'Jake' as our spouse, but realize we may have a 'Mickey', but really want to kid ourselves to think we could always roll over in the AM to see our 'Doug' - wake up and smell the 'monkey coffee'. I am married, with kids, a woman who had a career and gave it up for family and can still relate to the 'Mickey' character. I think people trash this show because it really does make them look at themselves in the mirror and ask yourself 'am I really happy with the choices I've made?' You then realize you are happy with what you have...you just have to remind yourself a couple times out of the day. I was totally disappointed when this show was cancelled - and hope somewhere down the line it will come around again. People may not want a 'Everyone loves Raymond' life - who can relate to that image of marriage, anyway? - Yikes....."
2,"This awful movie was really painful to watch. A small group from a wagon train linger behind to repair a broken down wagon in hostile Indian territory. They spend most of their time arguing and filibustering and take forever and a day to repair the wagon and attempt to catch up with the wagon train - I felt like I was watching Gilligan's Island. Any excuse to stay behind and mingle with the Indians was used to prolong the situation, (*spoiler*) including a slender pregnant woman who wasn't due anytime soon going into labor 3 days later (*spoiler* - NOT!...if you couldn't see this lame plot device coming, you must be living in a cave). The agony of this movie was painfully protracted. Of course, they have 4 cases of 25 Kentucky Rifles each (100 rifles) that must get through...or must they? Hmmm, why don't we show these rifles to the Indians and see if they want them? For that matter, why don't we see if the Iranians would like a few nuclear weapons? Yes, there is a lot of moralizing here, and if you don't know by now that giving your best weapons to your worst enemies because you are afraid of them is not an intelligent thing to do, then this movie will hammer that obvious point home and do it with a psychopathic vengeance that is firmly rooted in the belief that every dead horse requires a really good beating! But, then again, with the size of the wagon train and the firm belief that these rifles are excellent protection against hostile Indians, it would have made much more sense to distribute 4 or 6 rifles to each wagon for protection than to leave these vitally necessary items behind packed in crates on a broken down wagon. It would serve these dolts right if their entire wagon train was slaughtered by Indians. But then we wouldn't have a movie, would we? That would have been a blessing."
1,"John Cassavetes' 1977 film Opening Night is, what critics usually call the work of such a significant artist, 'overlooked'. It is an excellent film, in its own right, and one of the best portraits of a midlife crisis ever put to film. It's not a perfect film, in that, at two hours and twenty four minutes it's about a half hour too long, and there's a bit too much emphasis on the drunkenness of the lead character Myrtle Gordon, played by Gena Rowlands, the wife of Cassavetes, long after we've gotten the point. But only Woody Allen's masterpiece, Another Woman, which also starred Rowlands, eleven years later, is a better portrait of the internal conflicts of an aging woman. Yet, Rowlands did win the Best Actress Award at the Berlin Film Festival for this portrayal, and it was well deserved. Often this film, written by Cassavetes, is easily compared to his earlier- and inferior- film, A Woman Under The Influence, but it's a spurious comparison. Rowlands' character in that film is severely mentally disturbed from the start, as well as coming from a blue collar background, while her characters in this film and in Allen's film are both artists who are haunted by apparitions. In this film it's the ghost of a dead young woman who can be seen as Myrtle's younger doppelganger, while in Allen's film it's her character's own past. Many critics have taken this film to be a portrait of an alcoholic, seeing Myrtle surround herself with enablers, such as a stage manager who tells her, during opening night, 'I've seen a lot of drunks in my time, but I've never seen anyone as drunk as you who could stand up. You're great!', but this is wrong, for alcohol isn't her problem- nor is her chain smoking. They are merely diversions from whatever thing is really compelling her to her own destruction, and much to Cassavetes' credit, as a storyteller, he never lets us find out exactly what's wrong with Myrtle, and despite her coming through in the end, there's no reason to expect that she has really resolved anything of consequence. This sort of end without resolution links Cassavetes directly with the more daring European directors of the recent past, who were comfortable in not revealing everything to an audience, and forcing their viewers to cogitate, even if it hurts.  Yet, the film recapitulates perfectly the effect of a drunk or fever lifting out of the fog, and as such the viewer again is subliminally involved in its drama. Whether or not Myrtle Gordon does recover, after the film's universe irises about her is left for each and every viewer to decide, and as we have seen before that lid closes, one's choices do matter."
2,"I got a chance to see this at CineVegas this year and I have to say I was very impressed.  The performances all around were well executed with a standout job by Josh Barclay Caras as Ben. He delivered a subtle performance that embodies the uncertainty of youth, coupled with the desire to fit in and find connection.  Writer/Director Carter Smith creates such a wonderfully dark and heavy atmosphere throughout the film. He really does an excellent job of creating a sense of foreboding in unique and original ways.  This is definitely a film worth seeing if you get a chance to do so."
0,"This movie was definitely not one of Mary-Kate and Ashley's best movies. I really didn't like it, and I was kind of disappointed in that movie. For some reason, it seemed like it was a movie that they put together really fast. In some parts, it got so boring that I had to fast forward it. It didn't have any bloopers or any exciting parts like their other movies."
0,"""The house of the spirits"" is quite awful. I live in South America, in a country that suffered a military dictatorship just like the one the movie tries to describe, and even though everyone knows movies may be far far away from reality, this particular movie treats viewers as both ignorant and stupid. Things are not so simple and linear as appears here, and of course political process are much more complicated and interesting that the plot in ""The house..."". If you can't show that complexity on screen is better not making a movie at all. There are a lot of examples of how can politics be seriously taken in cinema, without so many commonplaces. In some parts I felt that Carmen Miranda may appear within parrots and palm trees. When you talk about certain things you must be not only careful but respectful to your public's intelligence."
2,"I can't believe there are people who like this movie. Of course, their opinion is as valid as mine, but it's hard for me to understand that. What's in this movie? A few pseudo-comic scenes, several references to old spanish TV programs and music hits (if you want to feel nostalgic with all that stuff you can watch a spanish TV documentary instead and that'll be surely better), and a surreal plot only understood by the people who made the film. I must confess I didn't laugh a single time, perhaps I smiled twice or three times during the whole movie. Sorry, Santiago, I don't like it !  My rating is 4 out of 10 (and I'm being generous because I'm spanish)."
2,"It seems like we're supposed to hate this one but I loved it, I'm sorry but there you go.  Maybe it was because it came out at the time when punk had just happened. To me the book & the movie were such a break from the usual stereotypical pro-authority nonsense we were being regularly served up at the time (and sadly we seem to have gotten back to these days).  Naturally the book was, by far, the better experience (a genuine 'laugh out loud' read to be highly recommended) but nevertheless I found both hilarious and a long overdue reality check on the forelock tugging blind belief in benevolent and always virtuous 'authority' (something which applies well outsides of the confines of any Police unit too).  I think it's a real pity we seem to have lost that very healthy irreverence & scepticism and are today saddled with way too much haughty hard-faced tedium and an expectation that we blindly trust authority figures."
0,"Nothing in this film interested me. I thought the actors were asleep while they were performing. That's not laid-back Stanislofsky method, that's just walking-through and saying lines, I'm afraid. Kidman's performance is sad. The story is, however, mildly entertaining if you want to put up with the bad acting."
0,"Five Across the Eyes starts as five young teenage girls are driving home in time for their curfew, they stop off at a store & accidentally hit another car & decide to just drive off & leave it. Soon after the other car forces them to stop & a crazy woman with a shotgun gets out & shouts at them, makes them take their clothes off & makes them pee on them & then randomly drives off. Shaken & shocked the girls think their ordeal is over but the crazy woman comes back for seconds as she seems intent on killing the terrified girls who are lost & are low on gas...  Produced & directed by Greg Swinson & Ryan Theissen with Swinson writing the thing & Theissen responsible for the cinematography & editing I have to say that Five Across the Eyes is easily one of the worst films I have ever seen if not the worst, I mean I'm struggling to think of a film I have seen that's worse. Now let me start off by saying that I am sure a lot of the film-making decision taken here were deliberate to try & provoke atmosphere, tension, realism & suspense but there is not one aspect of Five Across the Eyes that I didn't hate it to be honest it looks like a bad home video that has been put up on YouTube & even then it's still slightly embarrassing & a frankly worthless waste of 90 odd minutes of my time that I could have been doing something more entertaining & fun like pulling my fingernails out with pliers. The reviews on the web seem quite positive but on the IMDb (the amount of 1 Star comments is revealing & they can't all be wrong, right?) & it's message board which I think is much more of an indicator of what the average person thinks it's absolutely trashed by just about everyone & the phrase 'the worst film I have ever seen' is used a few times & to be fair most of these negative comments mention th same things & I have to agree with them. The story is terrible, alright I suspect it's meant to be minimalistic but this minimal? There's never any reason or explanation for the events that happen & it just feels totally random. It goes on for ages, the amount of plot here would struggle to fill a thirty minute made for telly program let along a full length feature. The dialogue is awful with these annoying girls who don't seem to have a brain cell between them taking about random stuff & screaming a lot. Oh god the screaming, there are seemingly endless scenes of these girls screaming or crying or whining which not only irritates & annoys & prevents any sane viewer feeling any sort of sympathy for them it also makes what they are trying to say almost impossible to hear properly. Then there's the real killer, the entire film is set & shot within the confines of a mini van, seriously the camera never leaves this car & as you can imagine it gets really boring, add that the low body count of just one person killed on screen & Five Across the Eyes is a film that I hated with a passion.  On a technical level again I can see that the film-making style here was a deliberate choice but I have to be honest again & say Five Across the Eyes is the worst looking film I have ever seen. As a fan of film I like my films to look like proper films as it's a visual medium & I definitely don't want them to look worse than the average YouTube video or my home films shot on a camcorder while I was drunk. It really does look that amateurish & that bad, it's a complete eyesore & I hated every moment of every second of it. Just think The Blair Witch Project (1999) only ten times worse looking & sounding & you will be almost there. There are times during Five Across the Eyes when you literally can't tell what's going on or happening because of the camera-work & the almost pitch black & grainy contrast levels. The violence is tame too with a few splashes of blood & a stabbing at the end.  Low budget doesn't even begin to describe Five Across the Eyes, with a supposed budget of about $4,000 this is easily one of the lowest budgeted films ever given a wide release. The two vans in the film were owned by members of the production & that's basically pretty much the entire budget right there, the locations. The acting is pretty bad by the main cast, I just hated all the fake put on crying & screaming that didn't convince at all but did irritate immensely.  Five Across the Eyes will go down as one of the worst films I have ever seen & I have seen a few films, whenever anyone now ask's me what's the worst film I have ever seen Five Across the Eyes will definitely get a mention. I hated it, every single aspect & wretched moment of it."
1,"""Like the first touch of pleasure and guilt, like a spontaneous youthful flirt of fascination and fear, like a climax of contrary emotions"" said one of the movie buffs after viewing LOVE AT THE TOP, the misinterpreted title version of stylish director Michel Deville's LE MOUTON ENRAGE.   Vincent Canby in New York Times, however, just after the 1974 premiere of the movie stated: ""LOVE AT THE TOP which opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse, is a 1973 French comedy that dimly recalls a number of nineteen-fifties English comedies about the rise and rise of cynical young men possessingand possessed byambition."" Yet, the significant difference that he mentioned was the fact that LOVE AT THE TOP is not concerned with the English class system...(January 27, 1975)  Having left the evaluations up to single individuals, of course, the test of time has done its just job. What may be said with certainty after more than 30 years is that we can hardly find such movies like LE MOUTON ENRAGE where decadence appears innocent, where liaisons appear youthfully enthusiastic, where feelings occur so manipulative.   For Romy Schneider's fans, it seems useless to point out that this film is a must see, not only because she gives a unique performance (as she did in all of her roles) at the heyday of her career (9 years before her sudden death) but because she is particularly attractive here. It is not TRIO INFERNAL where the, so to say, 'forced escape' from and the mockery of Romy's sweet image haunted for years by saccharine Sissi meets its most discouraging manifestation, but a film where the brilliant actress is given a fair role. She plays Roberte, a woman who becomes the object of lust for the story's lead, playboy Nicolas Mallet (Jean Louis Trintignant). It is him who takes financial profits from lustful liaisons. This movie can boast truly memorable and unique shots of Romy and she is given some of her very best scenes. Romy's sex appeal is unforgettable here.  Another strong point of the film is its execution of the content with a development of individual perception. Immoral as it may seem, the director makes a perfect use of contrast: conventions vs pleasures, innocence vs decadence, genuine lust vs instrumental affair. Nicola owns most of the features that viewers may like or detest, may find attractive or disgusting; yet, his are the features the viewers must treat seriously, more to say, they are the ones we all must accept. That is why, one is led to a peculiar, gently wild, erotically unique world of the main character. Although he sleeps with lots of women, there are two women that represent a sort of contrary worlds for Nicola: Roberte Groult (Romy Schneider) and Marie-Paul (Jane Birkin). He manipulates them, makes love to them, cannot refrain from both desire for their bodies and desire for money; yet, he perceives them differently. Yet, despite all of this 'adult maturity,' he is emotionally like a little boy who plays with a toy-car on the table - a sort of 'detailed insight into male mind...' in a comedy-like way, of course.  Finally, there are very good performances, which makes LE MOUTON ENRAGE slightly underrated. Not only the aforementioned Romy Schneider does a brilliant job supplying the viewers with an extraordinary insight into her role, but young Jane Birkin appears to be convincing in the role of young, inexperienced streetwalker Marie Paul, Jean Louis Trintignant makes it possible to see Nicola in the right way. This artistic merit lying in performances goes with terrific music by Camille Saint-Saëns, the tune that will ring in your ears for long. Therefore, apart from some flaws of the movie like dated colors, slow action (sometimes), possible clichés (noticed by some viewers), the merits should be found significant.   LE MOUTON ENRAGE, in sum, is a clear manifestation of contrary manipulative tools in life. It is worth seeing as a moment in Romy's career, a prelude to strong eroticism, a chain of contrary emotions, of love and hatred, appreciation and disgust compared to the first orgasm and the first angasm... But aren't we, humans, 'viewers,' movie buffs built upon such contrasts?"
2,"I don't get Big Brother. I read George Orwell's novel 1984 where we are introduced to Big Brother, the watcher of all of us or at least in this case, these poor suckers who choose to live together under close watch by millions of poor Britons. This is the not the masterpiece theater exported around the world. This television show is all the rage in England on Channel 4 no less. They spend countless hours observing these young Britons and my sister loves it but I can't take it. I'm going to give the show a 2 because Imogen reacted when she was kicked out like I would have. I would have been begging the audience to get me off this sinking ship. I'm sorry but this is degrading to both sexes and the young. Who wants to be exploited for a hundred thousand pounds? I wouldn't do it for less than a million and I don't think I would survive. Let me answer questions or do something with my mind. Nicki's screaming is unbearable and the gay Canadian is annoying. Is there a requirement that there must be one gay or lesbian person in the group. The couples won't last off the set. Sorry folks, don't let your children be watching this rubbish as they say and I agree. This show is appalling to watch and can be addictive. I'm glad that I'm in my thirties and not my twenties."
2,"""Doc Hollywood"" is a lovely film that deserves a wide audience. It captures some wonderful truths about small-town life in modern America, namely that it is wrong to assume naiveite among its inhabitants, and that the most mundane practice of arcane knowledge, such as medicine, can be the most fulfiling. My only caveat in the entire film appears early on when Julie Warner appears fully frontally nude. She's lovely naked and the shot is completely within the context of the story of the film. But many people might be put off by the nudity and it might be enough for them to not want their children to see the film. That is completely understandable but it is also a shame because with the exception of that shot, the film is wonderful for all ages. I highly recommend ""Doc Hollywood"" but if female nudity bothers you, then avoid it."
2,"This was yet another example, when it came out in 2000, of the latest strides being made in animation, computer-or-otherwise. At the time, I thought to myself, ""Man, this just gets better and better all the time."" Six years later, I am still saying that but with newer animated efforts.  Some of the scenes in here look so real you wouldn't know they were drawings. The colors are particularly good in the opening minutes. They are just stunning at times.  The story is pretty interesting, too. It's not great, but not boring, either, and not too kid-oriented. Adults can enjoy this. In fact, I was surprised at the amount of violence. That, and some of the jokes actually make this more for adults than kids in many spots.  I recommend the movie for its story and innovative techniques."
1,"This movie is great.  Now, I do tend to like my films heavy on the story and dialogue, but now and then, something like Moonwalker comes along, and it's watchable, despite numerous flaws.  This film is no more than a highly entertaining Michael Jackson advertisement. Beginning with sickly video set to 'Man in the Mirror' a montage listing his achievements, and bits and bobs from his career, it goes through all the highs of his life, then crashes down into a really, really entertaining segment which acts as a funny music video for 'Bad' and 'Speed Demon', following the adventures of MJ as he runs from manic stop-motion fans, and finally dancing against a rabbit costume. The stop motion isn't that bad as some would have you believe. It's passable.  Then we see the great video for 'Leave me alone', and straight into the main feature.  Yes, the plot is laughable. Very laughable. We see Michael walk out of a building, then get shot at by thousands of troops. Then we hit flashback, showing MJ and three children stumbling upon an underground lair. 'Mr Big' (Joe Pesci) is the nefarious villain who has a plan to get every child in the world hooked on 'drugs' (no specifics are mentioned) at an early age. MJ and the little girl he is with get caught, then chased... yada yada yada. The plot isn't really the important part. We get two very cool sequences where MJ turns into a car, then a robot-spaceship thing, and of course, the amazing 'Smooth Criminal' sequence.  It's a so-so film, but it is fantastic for anyone who likes MJ. It has most of his greatest hits, and some cool little bits, and some quite good special effects (the Robot/Spaceship sequence in particular) Worth it, especially seen as though you can pick it up for about a quid on ebay. It'll keep the kids quiet for a couple of hours, as well as most 20 somethings who were kids when it was first released."
2,"I consider Vic Reeves Big Night to be one of the finest comedy shows ever to have adorned British television. It was brilliantly funny, incredibly inventive and superbly performed. It is comedy in the true sense, in that the objects or names that Vic mentions (eg when he's looking at what the man with the stick has written on his helmet) are funny in themselves. Reeves and Mortimer had an unerring ability to know exactly what was funny. So one type of vegetable is funny, another is not. The mere mention of one celebrity's name is funny, another is not. This is observational comedy in its purest form, and a sign of witty, perceptive minds. Get the DVD of this and keep it close. They don't make many like this."
2,"I'm watching this movie for the first time on Sky One, and am trying really hard to feel surprised at the twist and turns of the (yawn) action!I read all of uncle Jules' books as a boy, and saw all the action movies of the 50s and 60s. I'm sure it's a childhood thing and these stories don't appeal much to me now. One of the previous comments mentions there are women in this movie, and there was none in the original book. This is mainly because our author lived in the days when men wrote about other men as adventurers, and left all the romantic stuff to women authors!So there is room for a little poetic license, or the film would be made exactly like the original! My thoughts drift back to ""Of Mice And Men'when George told Lennie his story about the farm they were going to live on and Lennie knew exactly how the story went, but insisted on hearing it anyway! This movie is the kind that attracts the fantasy fan, but I'm watching it all the way through, despite the urge to fall asleep and dream it better for myself! So far I give it 2 out of 10, but this could all change in an hour or so!   0 for 4, better than 2001! Keep 'em coming!"
2,"This is a pretty well done piece of English wartime film, made in 1942 and clearly intended to buck up the English as they faced the possibility of a German invasion. In the story, the small village of Bramley End is occupied by German paratroopers, who infiltrate the village disguised as English troops, along with the help of a local ""Quisling"" named Oliver Wilsford, played by Mervyn Johns. Seen with the benefit of hindsight, the story is rather far-fetched, since there really was no serious threat of a German invasion after 1940, but of course those making the movie (and those watching it) didn't have the benefit of hindsight, and so it has to be seen for what it is: a well done bit of movie-making encouraging the English to fight back in case it did happen.  In Bramley End, a pretty good (and ultimately successful) fight was put up once the locals got over their shock, and the fight involved men, women and children; soldiers and civilians alike. The Germans (as expected) are portrayed as ruthless (although, given the context, I thought they might have been portrayed even worse than they were.) Although it clearly was propaganda to an extent, the movie didn't have what I would consider to be a typical ""propaganda"" feel to it, which I appreciated, and which makes it interesting rather than dated even today. Speaking from a North American perspective, I confess that at times I had a bit of trouble following the accents, but the flow of the story was clear enough in spite of this, and I thought Oliver's ultimate fate at the hands of Nora (Valerie Taylor) represented poetic justice.  The movie opens and closes with a narration which is set in the post-war era, and is perhaps the only thing that seems really out of place today, with references to Hitler getting what was coming to him (I don't think he really did) and speaking of the invasion that finally came (which it didn't.) Aside from that, though, I found this movie quite enjoyable. 7/10"
2,"I didn't seem to think of this as being the unintentional laugh riot that many others acclaim it to be. Despite a few humorous and borderline surreal moments, it was very slow moving and actually depressing. I've never been a massive fan of Al Adamson's films, as in addition to being mean-spirited, they're kind of generic. Plus, he always filled them up with once great stars who were obviously way past their prime. Both J. Carrol Naish and Lon Chaney Jr look like absolute wrecks in this one. If you remember them in the 40s and than watch this, you'll probably become extremely depressed. In addition to those stars, Adamson manages to pick the most wooden and untalented actors for other roles. Sure, some of the fun of watching bad movies derives from the horrible acting, but eventually the lack of any remote skill becomes tiresome instead of amusing. Its pretty obvious that Regina Carrol was cast only because she was Mrs. Adamson, and Zandor Vorkov may well be the most uninspired Dracula ever on screen. Even the final monster mash is a bit of a let-down, as its too dark to really see whats happening on screen.  As you can see, I am not a fan of this film or Adamson's works in general. Unlike Ed Wood, Phil Tucker, or H.G. Lewis, his bad films aren't usually ""good"" bad films. They'll have their moments for sure but overall will be very inconsistent. The only film by him I can legitimately say I enjoyed was ""Satan's Sadists"". Not to be confused with Paul Naschy's even worse ""Dracula Vs. Frankenstein"" from 1969 or a later Jess Franco film. (2/10)"
2,"I was very moved by the personal stories in the film. The movie had suspense, emotion, music, and drama, which I didn't expect from a political film. I think the movie can be very useful for communities trying to understand the legal process of changing gay marriage laws, and the personal ramifications of the changes themselves. As we left the movie tonight, my husband said, ""That was much better than I expected it to be."" We were both very impressed by the professionalism of this film. I hope it makes it to the big screens.  I really like documentaries. I would put this one right up with Michael Moore's and Jesus Camp for bringing home an issue in a very personal, and profound way. Great job.  The only small complaint I have about this film is that the scenes with the political election near the end seems to go on too long. I would love to see that edited some more, and then an update on what has happened since. The film needs a more dramatic ending, but 99% of it was stellar film-making, in my book.  I wish them well with this extremely important subject."
2,"As a teenager, my father and I would go to the local video store and rent a horror movie almost every week. After we got through all the flicks that we had at least heard of, we started on ones we never heard of. One of these flicks was ""Screamtime."" As stated, this film has three small stories in it. One was about a puppet that may or may not be killing people. This one is okay. The second story was about fairy's that protect this old ladies house and it was pretty dang good. The final one is the best though. It is about a family that moves into a house and the wife keeps seeing murded bodies that are not there. This one has a killer twist at the end that makes this movie worth finding and buying. You can normally get in on Ebay on VHS."
2,"We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that. As to this movie, it is extremely wonderful for everyone especially the kids. We loved it. Dakota Fanning is destined to be one of the top actresses of all time and she is only 11? Every movie she makes is simply the best. She is one in a million. The supporting actors in the movie are equal to the task. Kurt Russell and Elizabeth Shue (It was great to see her again) are extremely pleasurable to watch. So go on your own or with the kids it is a lot of fun."
2,"The main problem with 'Jacked Up' is the incredibly unrealistic storyline. A boy 'accidentally' shoots a cop while stealing his car. The same boy, with a typically bad conscience, believes he should get to know the cop's family. The whole cast look older than the characters they portray are. For example Dre looks in his twenties when he has only just finished high school. It's small errors like this that are 'Jacked Up's' downfall. Another problem is the acting of the 'gangsters' in the story, their is know real evil in the characters. This makes some of the characters less believable. Other than these minor mistakes, 'Jacked Up' is an enjoyable film. A advise it to any viewer who can buy a copy from under £10.  8/10"
2,"I like Wes Studi & especially Adam Beach, but whoa is this movie a load of pretentiousness. Ponderously slow. Overly cryptic to the point of obfuscation, not because the plot warrants it but because there is almost no plot. Even less in the way of characterization. This is almost like one of those creaky old Charlie Chan mysteries (the cheaper Monogram studio versions) with lots of red herrings & oddball characters (like the old ex-senator with the checkered past who is now a recluse) & loads of people getting killed over objets d'art that you wouldn't look twice at in the mall. Great scenery, though. Pretty hair on the redhead, too, although I never did figure out what she was doing in this at all. Neither could my wife. Sheesh, at least the old B-movies had the decency to be short."
2,"Iron Chef USA sounded like it would be a suitable compliment to the great Japanese version of Iron Chef, which was always elegant and well produced.  A slap in the face and utter flop, Iron Chef USA was a circus joke and mockery to the original, from the flashy, disrespectful Chairman to the bimbo interviewer. What a disappointment and supreme embarrassment. Thank goodness old Japanese Iron Chef reruns exist!"
0,"I registered just to make this comment (which pretty much echos some of the ones here already) The acting is worse than subpar, it expounds on commonly held stereotypes, has some of the worst displays of tasteless female objectification (all bod no brain), and has some of the cheesiest lines known to man.  including but not limited to ""allright lets see what these guys can do"" I should also mention that when they show the crashes involving innocent civilians, you end up feeling bad for the innocent people and start to hate the characters themselves. Eddie Griffin's character is also one of the most stereotypical black guy personas that just rubs people the wrong way. He may or may not be a good actor but this movie doesn't allow for that kind of character exploration. You want a movie that leaves the audience on the side of the bad guys? Oceans 11. This movie just makes you hate the bad guys instead of capturing the audience.  Even the cars can't make up for this fluke of a movie. That Enzo that Griffin wrecked sums up this movie perfectly. It just sucks."

2,"Warner Bros. fantasies have always had a certain memorable flare. Dating back to films like ""Superman"" and ""Blade Runner"", a viewer could always be guaranteed at least a ticket into another world. ""The Avengers"" would have been that next ""big"" thing for Warner Bros. had it not been so shoddily edited at the last minute. It should be duly noted, however, that this film had all the signs of a thanksgiving turkey: It's release date, which was moved from late June to the dog days of August. Then the fact that no press screenings have been allowed for critics. No good can come of these prophecies.  ""The Avengers"", which, at best, is a second rate version of the original ""Batman"" has all the features of your top blockbuster: A Big name or two, a plethora of explosions, and enough special-effects to put ""Godzilla"" to shame. The Plot follows the exploits of the legendary secret agents John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), as they do battle with a maniacal meteorologist (Sean Connery) who has intentions on controlling the world's weather. Simple enough. Or so one would have thought. It would appear that some 25 minutes (!) was excised from the film as a result of poor test screenings. As history has told, no good comes from test screenings. As a result, the film becomes so utterly confusing that the viewer would sooner give up, rather than be insulted by a film that insists on staying one step ahead of you at all times. Only potentially good films are butchered in an attempt to make the film more appealing to youngster's attention spans. But make no mistake about it, this film is certainly not for children. Perhaps the last half hour will provide enough enjoyable action (and it does, believe me!) to distract them, but up until then the film consists of awkward dialogue, inane action (Gigantic teddy bears, anyone?), and an uncomfortable overdose of strangeness.  The cast, at one time, might have been game, but only once in a while does Ralph Fiennes even crack a smile. Thurman has apparently got the English accent down perfectly, but the only problem lies in the fact that she forgets to give a performance worth remembering. And last, but certainly not least, Sean Connery. Sadly, he doesn't even look like he wants to take over the world. Only once, in a mumbled rant, does he evoke some feelings of evil. That being said, ""The Avengers"" is a technical masterpiece. Providing the viewer with a universe of dazzling sets (that should at least be nominated for an oscar), imaginative visual effects, and beautiful costumes, one almost forgets that England doesn't look like this anymore. Unless of course, you live there. The score, composed by Joel McNeely proves to be one of the coolest scores ever produced. Inducing excitement, tension, and a little smoothness, provided by some nifty jazz notes. All of which the film is unable to do itself. For those who won't enjoy this film, it is mercifully brief. So brief to the point that it's strange. It jumps from a one hour section of the beginning to a half hour of climactic action that the viewer blinks and the movie might just be rolling into the credits. One can only hope for an improvement with a director's cut. Until then, this film should gain cult status before it makes it's way to video. Which I'm sure will be soon.  Out Of Four - **"
2,"""Dream Demon"" features some imaginative visuals and clever camera shots, but is doomed by its terribly confusing, almost indecipherable plot. When it's all over, few answers have been given to the viewer and the rules of the dream-vs-reality game are never explained. This picture remains a blurry enigma from beginning to end. (*1/2)"
2,"This movie isn't very good. It's boring, and not much blood for a horror film. The plot just trods along with not much happening. And I think the female vampire was so stupid. She had many chances to kill the vampire hunters since it shows her having lighting like reflexes. But, whenever she has one of them pinned, she just takes her time and something always happens where she doesn't bite them. No wonder this went straight to cable.  FINAL VERDICT: Not anywhere near as good as the first Vampire movie. You're a SUCKER if you waste your time on this."
1,"This is a great little film, that's very unique, and creative, with some great plot twists and wonderful performances!. All the characters are great, and the story while bizarre, is fascinating and very interesting, plus Nicole Kidman is simply amazing in this!. It's very hard to describe this movie, because it really is quite bizarre, it's a comedy/romance, one minute then it turns into a thriller the next, however it was still very entertaining all the same, plus Nicole's Russian accent was fantastic, and extremely convincing. Chaplin and Kidman had very good chemistry together, and i loved Vincent Cassel's performance!, plus some of the plot twists really took me by surprise!. The ending was very cute, and it's unpredictable throughout!, plus this movie is quite underrated as well!. You will feel sorry for Chaplin and the way that he is scammed, and i thought all the characters were really likable, plus the finale is especially good.This is Nicole's movie though, and she carries it with her incredibly sexy performance!. This is a great little film, that's very unique, and creative, with some great plot twists and wonderful performances!, i highly recommend this one!. The Direction is very good!. Jez Butterworth does a very good job here, with great camera work, solid angles and keeping the film at a fast pace!. The Acting is wonderful!. Nicole Kidman, is stunningly gorgeous!, and is amazing as always, she is incredibly sexy, very likable, had one of the coolest accents, added a lot of presence, had very good chemistry with Ben Chaplin, and had a very mysterious character!, she was amazing. (Kidman Rules!!!!). Ben Chaplin is great here, he is extremely likable, had a cool character, had very good chemistry with Kidman, the only thing i didn't like was him taking out his anger out on Kidman, even though what she did was wrong, and i loved how he got revenge in the end!. Vincent Cassel is fantastic as the main villain, yes he was OTT, but he was very intense and quite creepy at times, this role was perfect for him. Mathieu Kassovitz is OK here, but didn't have much to do. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall i highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5"
2,"'Fearless Freaks' is an excellent documentary that's sure to please longtime fans like myself as well as newer fans, and will probably win them a fair batch of new followers. As 'Watch me Jumpstart' does with Robert Pollard of Guided by Voices, it paints an intimate portrait of head Lip Wayne Coyne as a family man and member of his community. We get plenty of interesting background into Coyne's early family life and nascent artistic aspirations. Interviews with band members, family members, and friends are inter-cut with raw live footage of the group's often very visually fascinating performances. The pace is just right to keep the viewer always entertained and never bored, but not at a breakneck, highly edited MTV-ish pace. My only complaint about the movie is that details on the band's history and specific works by them are rather skimpy. I would have liked to have gotten more details such as Wayne explaining his inspirations for various songs, discussions about their creative process, studio stories, and the like.  Drummer Steven Drozd becomes the other major character in this movie when his addiction to heroin is frankly and almost shockingly discussed and portrayed on film. Without giving too much away, this subplot comes to an apparently happy ending, and the movie concludes on a high note, with The Flaming Lips on stage playing before their enthralled fans, on the verge of another artistic triumph. Here's to The Flaming Lips."
2,"I haven't seen a whole lot of this show, but I've seen enough to know it never should have been aired. Fox seemed to be trying to get a quick buck from a less-than-mediocre excuse for television. After the success of That 70s Show, Fox should have had the sense to realize it wouldn't work to do it for every single decade. It tried to copy That 70s Show, but didn't have the heart or the character. It's no wonder it only lasted half a season. They tried, but it was a miserable, miserable failure. I love That 70s Show, but this doesn't even come close to living up to half of it's predecessor. The idiot who came up with this should be completely ashamed. DON'T WATCH."
2,"The turgid screen adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's 1973 masterpiece A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC is probably in the top five of worst adaptations of Broadway musical to the motion picture screen. The musical, based on the Ingmar Bergman film SMILES OF SUMMER NIGHT, follows the revolving lives of three couples who clearly at the beginning are mismatched and how they end up being with their soulmates by the end of the film. Elizabeth Taylor, looking fat and tired, sleepwalks her way through the film and enough has been said about her singing so I won't even go there. Director Hal Prince did have the sense to hire Len Cariou and Laurence Guittard to repeat their stage roles Freidrich and the Count, who both think they are in love with Desiree, but even these two charismatic actors come off as stilted. Lesley Ann-Downe is a lovely woman but she just looked way too old to be playing Freidrich's young wife, Anne, who in the original script, was 18. The only completely satisfying performance in the film is by Diana Rigg as the Countess, who brings so much more to the role than the screenplay allows and also surprisingly gives the film its loveliest musical moment with her rendition of ""Every Day a Little Death."" Speaking of music, I found it interesting that Prince felt the need to completely overhaul one of the most beautiful musical scores ever written for the stage. Hermione Gingold's role as Desiree's mother is reduced to a glorified cameo since they chose to cut her song, ""Liasons"". The Count also has a gorgeous solo in the show called ""In Praise of Women"" which was also cut. The song ""The Glamorous Life"" was rethought and became a solo for Desiree's daughter, Fredrika, charmingly played by Chloe Franks. They also cut ""The Miller's Son"" a powerhouse of a song sung by Petra, the maid. I could go on ad nauseum about what's wrong with this movie, but that would be pointless. I just cannot fathom how Hal Prince so horrifically screwed up the screen version of a musical HE directed on Broadway. In an eggshell, the only reason to see this film is if you live for Diana Rigg."
0,"My giving this a score of 3 is NOT what I would give the original Soviet version of this film. It seems that American-International (a studio that specialized in ultra-low-budget fare in the 60s) bought this film and utterly destroyed it--slicing a two hour plus film into a 64 minute film! Plus, much of this 64 minutes was new material (such as the ""monsters"")--so you know that this film bears almost no similarity to the original. The original film appears to be a rather straight drama about the Soviet conquest of space--though I really am not sure what it was originally! For insight into the original film, read Steven Nyland's review--it was very helpful.  By the way, this was the third Soviet sci-film I've seen that American-International bought and then hacked apart to make a ""new"" film--standard practice to a company that was willing to put just about anything on the screen to make a buck--provided, of course, it didn't cost them much more than a buck in the first place!! This Americanized film was about two rival world powers (NOT the US and Soviets) trying to be the first to Mars. The tricky ""bad guys"" try but fail and the ""good guys"" rescue one of the idiot astronauts and then head to Mars. Unfortunately, they are temporarily stranded on a moon of Mars where they see some monsters (added by American-International) that are REAAAALLY cheesy and one does bear similarity to a certain part of a female's anatomy. Then, they are rescued--returning to Earth heroes.  The bottom line is that the film was butchered--turning an incredibly beautiful piece of art (for the time) being turned into a grade-C movie. Because of this, the Soviets really had a reason to hate America! I'm just shocked that the horrible job A-I did with this film didn't convince them to refuse to sell more films to these jerks! It's worth a look for a laugh, but the really bad moments that make you laugh are few and far between. So, the film is a dud--not bad enough to make it a must-see for bad movie buffs and too dopey to be taken seriously. I would really love to see this movie in its original form--it must have been some picture."
2,"The movie was very bad, it poked fun at religion, several sexual oriented and suggestive scenes. I do not recommend for any child to watch this movie the parents will be left to explain a lot to the children and the child will be exposed to a lot of suggestive, ignorant content. I do not recommend a person waste their money on this. I was expecting this movie to be hysterical and fun to see, but instead I was disappointed and bored. I only laughed at a few parts and I left the movie disappointed. The vulgar language was annoying and I heard other people who went to see the movie discuss how disappointed they were as well. I do not recommend this movie, it was a disappointment and not funny at all just boring, stupid and offensive. Fairwarning, I am going to tell you a spoiler so don't read beyond this point...  The movie is basically The Chronicles of Narnia just redone to incorporate other movies such as the x-men, Harry Potter, Pirates of the Carebbean, the Divinchi Code and more. This was not funny and a complete disappointment and focused on sex and made fun of religion."
2,"Basically ""Shoot'Em Up"" is an 80's film using today's modern technology. Replace Arnie or Bruce Willis with Clive Owen and baby in tow and you have this film. Owen's carrot fixation is even put to good use pulling triggers and stabbing the villains in the eyeball or through the mouth and out the back of their necks. See how Owen kills special ops assassins while having sex with ""hooker with a heart of gold"" Monica Belluci(..she even climaxes as he blows one of these heavily equipped villains through a window). There are a great many stunts where Owen is allowed to create on his feet using his artistry with guns. There's a neon sign he uses to tell arch-nemesis Paul Giammati F-U. Just watch how Owen uses his gun to keep his baby protected on a merry-go-round. Or, when he's in a weapons factory, with Owen elaborately creating a method using strings to develop a labyrinthine maze where baddies carrying machine guns fall prey to gun fire when they turn corners(..even if this is the most ludicrous action sequence ever designed, it's a dream come true for action fans). And, the greatest trick of all..pulling off an anti-gun message in such an insanely violent action film! The way the film finds escapes for Owen is a thing of cinematic genius..no matter how many times we roll our eyes at such absolute nonsense.  The plot,if it truly matters, is about a man minding his own business who can not sit on his street bench and watch a pregnant woman get assassinated. This decision will cause a ton of complications as he assists the lady into giving birth. His *name* is Smith, and the head-honcho who wants the lady and her child dead is Hertz(Giammatti). When a bullet through the forehead leaves this woman dead, Smith will have to find shelter for the infant while dodging constant gun-fire. Thanks to his uncanny use with an assassin's gun(..there was a reason why he didn't have a gun on his person even though he is a skilled marksman), Smith evades his pursuers sending a great many villains to early graves(..or, as chief businessman Hammerson, played by a scarily skinny Stephen McHattie, would say, a ""dirt nap""). Hoping for a hooker's(Bellucci) help, whose specialty is feeding her breast-milk to wealthy clientèle with that kinky fetish, he will hope to provide the infant with a temporary home(..in a brothel!). But, Hertz targets her so this hooker will join up with Smith and the baby on their own forming one very unique union. With Hertz undaunted despite heavy losses when several operations to kill Smith fail miserably, he will keep coming until our hero can discover why these murderers want such a precious child dead. Soon the story yields some wacky results like a bone-marrow transplant for an ill senator who wishes to pursue the presidency(..and has a strict policy against guns which would threaten Hammerson's business)as the child is the key to his health and recovery, and an airplane meeting between Smith and who he thought were his allies(..this soon produces a parachute exit and shoot-out in the sky for the ages). And, to top it all off, watch how Smith, with broken fingers, uses a scalpel to evade certain doom. It's all tongue-in-cheek and unpretentious fare, gory escapist fodder for fanboys who love their constant shoot 'em ups with bullet-ridden bodies & colorful villains and dialogue. Outrageous, tricky ways a gun can kill people are on full display. And, this flick rarely takes a breath. Not a critical darling AT ALL, even hated by many, but I dug the hell out of it. Oh, and the use of a tank(..and how Owen provides a way for Bellucci and babe to enter in)for the use of protection so that the baby can remain safe, is just priceless."
2,"Set in 1970 (later 1985), ""a strange, extraterrestrial spool is discovered at the site of the 1906 mystery explosion in Tunguska, Siberia.

Reportedly popular in its original form (""Der schweigende Stern""), this film's obviously anti-nuclear subtext is most interesting; apparently, the Communist satellite governments shared an apprehension over atomic war.

2,"This movie has a wonderful quality that would bring any distant family together. My children and I loved watching it together. It's nice to have a movie finally come out that everyone can enjoy. I highly recommend seeing it. Emma Thompson is so endearing. Colin Firth is such a lost soul trying to avoid everything and everyone around him. Angela Landsbury is so over the top, but very funny. Together they make such an interesting trio. The love, the comedy, the magic, and the unbelievable happy ending make it more than just a fairy tale, they make it a story that makes you wish that it was all happening to you. For children, it sets their minds imaginations into over-drive. It sends them to a place that lets their minds run free to believe in everything on the big screen in front of them. For just an adult, I would say, it would be less special, as apposed to an adult who has children to watch get engaged with this magical movie."
1,"""Pandora's Clock"" is a gripping suspense/thriller that's a cross between a virus movie and a disaster film. This movie, which aired in two parts on NBC in its debut showing in 1996, is about an airplane flight that becomes infected with a virus when one of the passengers just happens to be carrying this disease. The U.S. Government debates on whether the plane should be destroyed or not, while the pilot (Richard Dean Anderson) and a virus expert (Daphne Zuniga) try to figure something out to avoid disaster. I'm not really a big fan of TV movies and miniseries, but I liked ""Pandora's Clock"". It's one heck of a thrill ride. Jane Leeves (TV's ""Frasier""), Robert Loggia, and Edward Herrmann (as the President) also star.  *** (out of four)"
2,"I give this one 2 points for its narrative attempt at trying to make it ""real,"" and one point for the filmmakers' truly laudable 'Efforts.'  Four generations of special-effects technology have already passed since J3 was made (maybe more... it was first released in theaters almost twenty-years ago), and the viewer simply can't get over its bad chroma-key mini-sub, cheesy 3-D props, et al.  However, like most badly executed thrillers with substandard ""eye-candy,"" J3 has a worthy message for all of us: Try to bottle Nature in an attractive Theme Park package, and nature will get back at you in a deadly, often gruesome way.  Most interesting here are the two-dimensional, stock characters. They surprise us in how they eventually evolve as the story comes to its inevitable conclusions...  What we may initially perceive as the secondary Villain (the manager of this aquatic theme park, ""Calvin""), turns out to be just an ordinary person at a loss for words, and tries his best to save the endangered tourists trapped underwater. Unlike the previous two films (in which we're subjected to the pig-headed-ness of one dollar-hungry Mayor), Calvin made me laugh when I realized his character was just all attitude and 'talk.' He is speechless when everybody realizes they have a serious situation on their hands: 35 feet of man-eating death!  The heroes (God save what's left of their present acting careers!) also prove brave and honorable.  My favorite character, however, was the calm and rational female tour guide that succeeded in 'tranquilizing' the trapped visitors until rescue divers could successfully bail them out. Here you have this short lady telling the much taller adults and children to conserve their energy and air, so that escape seems all the more possible.  Brief Review: J2 was pretty much along the same lines as its original... except here we have a regatta of mostly teens and twenty-somethings trying to stay afloat, and the shark in question keeps getting bigger by the time we reach J4.  J4 stinks and sinks! Pray that someday we'll all be allowed to go back to our beaches without the likes of Michael Caine and Lorraine Gary polluting our oceans. These landlubbers belong either on the Broadway stage or beside their mogul husbands, sitting quietly counting their box-office money.  See Jaws 3. If anything, it's great watching this truly unique aquatic show, where 'red popcorn' goes flying off into the audience.  "
2,"John Payne is driving his nice Chevy van filled with flowers and minding his own business when some peeping Tom decides to use him for less than legal purposes. That rascally Preston Foster is a smart bad guy with a plan to rob the bank.  This movie should have been called ""Four Kings."" You will see why when you watch it. ""Four Kings and a Queen"" would be even better. ""Kansas City Confidential"" is OK, but it would not become a magnet that attracted people into the theater.  Excellent performances by John Payne, Preston Foster, Jack Elam, Neville Brand and Lee Van Cleef. Coleen Gray does her part very well, also. She reminds me somewhat of a Gale Storm with the perky, happy quality usually not found in a gangster flick.  This one could definitely be remade with a great cast today and it should do well. The story is solid. The few plot holes are minor and do not make us wonder.  The musical score is also excellent. I was impressed with the camera work throughout. One scene in particular lets us see some guys getting onto a boat while we could still watch a nice old Mercury woody wagon and its occupant in the background. Many great 40s and early 50s vehicles here.  A really good 50s B&W film.  Tom Willett"
2,"Joan, with director Sherman, trimming *all* the fat away from *Craig's Wife* (that means removing every scene in which Joan would *not* be present), and turning it into a tour-de-force for La Crawford. As the epitome of every neurotic, deeply disturbed female that Joan ever portrayed, *Harriet Craig* is Joan with a capital J. Taking the role in her mouth and shaking it into submission, she is playing, ultimately, another facet of Joan herself. But what Joan film role *didn't* become Joan herself  either before or *after* filming? In a case of Joan's art imitating her life, as well as her life imitating her art, Harriet provides Joan with yet *one* more of those peculiar roles  roles which must have been written with *only* Joan in mind, since it would be difficult to imagine *any* other actress in this role. If Rosalind Russell had had this much focus on her in *her* version, *Craig's Wife*, it's hard to imagine if she could have sustained it, since part of Russell's strength was her ability to respond to other characters while seemingly on a course all her own. But Joan, never one to shy away from *any* movie role, makes *Harriet Craig* one the great milestones of her career. And we are indebted to her for it. As she explains to her niece (she *always* has nieces in movies like this  sweet young things who come to live with her and become her indentured servants) about how to ""keep men in line,"" we are given more pure-Joan philosophy. With lines like, ""the average woman *does* put her life in someone else's hands  her husbands'. That's why she usually comes to grief,"" and ""No man is *born* ready for marriage  he has to be trained,"" it is familiar Joan territory. Familiar now, because we've seen Joan spackling her angst all over movie and TV screens for decades, but along with *Mildred Pierce*, *Queen Bee* and *Torchsong*, *Harriet Craig*, at the time, was a new dimension in Joan's personal psychosis committed to film."
2,"Yesterday, in my lunch time, I saw this new-released DVD on sale in a store. I had no information about ""La Niña Santa"", but its cover had the symbols of participation in the Cannes, Toronto and New York Festivals, and four favorable reviews (from ""Le Monde"", ""Premiere"", Sergio Rizzo (unknown for me) from the ""Folha de São Paulo"" and ""New York Times""). When I read the name of one of the producers, Pedro Almodóvar, and that this movie was awarded in the ""Mostra International de Cinema de São Paulo"", I unfortunately decided to buy it.  ""La Niña Santa"" is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The screenplay is terrible: the viewer can see that the story is in a Latin country (Argentina indeed), but the explanation is only found reading the cover of the DVD. It takes thirteen minutes to understand that the location is a hotel welcoming a conference of physicians and surgeons. The group of gossipy girls in a choir is never explained if they belong to a church or school. The amateurish framing recalled my son, when he was a baby boy and had some trouble to use the camcorder, cutting heads, shoulders, legs of feet in his footages; the same happens along the whole movie. Based on the foregoing remarks, the poor direction is simply terrible. Last but not the least, even the cast composed by ugly actors and actress is not attractive. My advice: although having a great lobby, do not waste your time and money in this crap. My vote is one.  Title (Brazil): ""A Menina Santa"" (""The Saint Girl"")"
2,"A complete cult film in Spain.  I think Alex is one of the most original talents in nowadays cinema. And not only in Spain, all over the world.  You have to realize what it means to issue such a film, and what a danger you take. How he uses black humour and keeps tension on every scene is incredible. And he has shown that in every one of his films, specially in The perfect crime (a pearl of how to use black humour), 800 bullets and Common Wealth. These are films to take with an open mind, no previous thoughts of what are you going to find. I'm still surprised at each one of his new films.  A masterpiece, but not a film for everybody."
0,"There are some things I can never understand. Such as this movie. What if I were to create a really really cheap and crappy looking Dino and crocodile polygon model in Maya and then proceed to cut and paste that into an amateur video clip having people scream and getting eaten by the same thing? How can anyone even believe that an utterly fake CGI dinocroc that looks completely out of place, would influence the events in this movie? I know that its B-grade, low budget and all but the producers could do better than making a piece of crap that no one will ever seen see or sit through. It just does'nt make sense. Are people really so stupid that they would sit through this? Apparently so. For laughs? No, this thing isn't even worth laughing at."
0,"I have just watched the movie for the first time. I wanted to watch it as I like Drew Barrymore and wanted to see one of her early movies.   The movie is about a girl (played by young and beautiful Drew Barrymore), who moves from NYC to LA in order to get over her recently troubled loss. Short after moving to a guy who falls in love with her, it becomes obvious that she has an evil twin=doppelganger, who haunts her.  The movie is quite poor and lousy. Both the dialogs and the acting make the film not really worth seeing it. Summing up it is just something for the fans of Drew Barrymore."
0,"The IMDb plot summary in no way describes the essence of this film. It should have read 'Be prepared to be catapulted back to the prison of the 3rd pew from the back of your family's church at 8 years old, listening to the preacher drone on about God's will while all you can think of is getting back home to your Lego'.  It starts off well intentioned, building intrigue by planting some real and surreal clues such as Renny's 'how did the cut on my thumb heal so fast?' moment. It then slowly morphs into a Christian jamboree, sacrificing its plot completely in a wash of evangelistic-induced babble. I believe I counted the use of the word 'pray' about 53 times in a five minute span near the end. After the 31st, I tried to twist the context of the word to its synonym, 'prey'. Sadly, this little mind game of mine made the film at least bearable for the last 20 minutes. Plus it made me laugh whenever a character would say 'prayer' ('preyer' to me) as it became totally zany. Indeed, even my Catholic wife sunk in her chair from boredom, almost to the point of ending up on the floor.  For all the salivating Christians who ranked this film 8-10 stars, I suggest sticking with your theology-reinforcing safety standards like Circle Square, The Ten Commandments, anything from Narnia, Jesus Christ Superstar and the like. Stay away from more cerebrally challenging subject matter in films such as Jesus Camp, The God Who Wasn't There, What Would Jesus Buy, or the soon-to-be released Religulous.  Maybe Robert Whitlow's book is better."
2,"A lot of people don't realize that this film was nominated not only for an Academy Award, but also a Golden Globe and Grammy Award! That third item gives it away -- the song ""The Day I Fall in Love"" from this movie garnered all of the nominations, and deservedly so. It's a wonderful composition performed brilliantly by Dolly Parton and James Ingram. It has become one of my favorite songs of all time and it easily outclasses this movie.  In my opinion it was practically a miracle that the song got honored by the three biggest award firms because the movie is nothing special and a lot of times brilliance goes unnoticed when it is contained in a sub-par film. Also the song got very little radio airplay; the video only appeared occasionally on VH-1.  At any rate, other than the superlative song, there are some cute dog scenes in this movie. And Debi Mazar is definitely a highlight as the 101 Dalmatians inspired villain.  My best recommendation is to watch the music video for the song. It includes all of the best highlights from the film (the aforementioned cute dog scenes), you'll hear the incredible song and get glimpses of the stunningly cute Ashley Hamilton and not end up hating him because of the schmuck his character ends up being in the film."
0,"All the funny things happening in this sitcom is based on the main character Jim being either a bad father, a bad husband or generally just enormously selfish. How can that be funny? Of course a character in a sitcom has to be flawed, but Jim's character is flawed in an extremely unsympathetic manner.  And why it that? My guess is that it's because ""he should now better"". Jim's not a stupid guy, he can take care of things and he's got the opportunities to do so. But he chooses not to. It's a conscious choice he makes, when he chooses to not play with his kids, not go shopping because he doesn't want to buy ""lady products"" and it's a choice he makes, when he puts down his relatives.  The other characters seems to only be in the series so Jim can have someone to be a jerk to. If the Cheryl character was a real person, she would have left him years ago, and not stay with the deadbeat for 8 years. But alas, she's just a catalyst for Jim's quirky middle-class extreme selfishness."
2,"it looks like this movie cost ten dollars to make. I love chuck but damn! this is so cheesy. the camera work sucks, its bad folks. the editing, you name it. what really worries me is the same producing team and company is working on Rambo 4. oh no! avi Lerner eh? looks like we have the next Golan globus. man even they hired better directors! there is no way this cost ten mil to make. that may have been chucks pay. the movie the perfect weapon was probably made for just about the same amount of money when that came out and that looked 100 times better than this movie. chuck! please do something with better film makers.  oh and what sucks is that whenever he encounters a bad guy, hmm he just happens to know martial arts too??? and oh man, the close ups were killing me. the one extreme close up on Tracy scoggins' face were really bad! those wrinkles! oy vey"
2,"Not quite excellent but Both James Brolin and Jill Clayburgh give creditable performances in one of Hollywood's great love stories. This film was re;eased the same year as ""WC Fields and Me"" about another Hollywood couple, Fields and Carlotta Monti. ""Gable and Lombard"" captures the Hollywood scene of the 1930's a bit better than the other film does, and the two leads are more believable then in the other film. More than showing the screen side of these two, ""Gable and Lombard"" explores the off screen life of the pair. Anyone looking for dirt will be greatly disappointed. The life of Clark Gable and Carol Lombard as shown in this film is anything but boring. Thus, the emotion is genuine when we learn as does Gable that nothing is forever.  ""Gable and Lombard"" gives us an honest look into the lives of two people who just happened to be movie stars."
2,"I love this film.   When the world awoke form it's boring funk, disco, brown-yellow-orange-colored slumber after Star Wars shook it awake and revived sci-fi, heavy metal appeared during the aftershocks and created albeit for a small public a visual feast.   Heavy metal is usually described as a void fest for stoners and granted with the proper intoxication the movie's charm is increased greatly. What makes heavy metal so appealing is what many people call it's principal flaws, the pubescent jokes, violence, plethora of nudity, the crude animation and often its bright explosive colors. But these are not flaws, in fact to anyone with a fun-loving nature and imagination these are virtues.   The script is wonderful, with lot's of crude jokes, that make excellent one-liners during parties. ""Death, death to all who oppose us"" has to be a classic introduction-line for a villain (who is menacingly one dimensional. And has anybody wondered where his helmet comes from?)At moment the script even becomes epic, like during the sequence where the council of elders summon Taarna.  Although the animation maybe dated and even downright ugly, it gives the movie it's charm, the same as Ralph Bakshi's animation gives it, it's cult-charm and those with imagination see what the animators tried to accomplish. The backgrounds are simply stunning. From epic landscapes with cycloptic animal skeleton's cradling entire cities to impressive space-vessels and space-stations(Mark the brick-motief of the space-station during the Sternn sequence,hahaha) The color schemes of these backgrounds are daring and vibrant.  And there are boobs, lot's of voluptuous big-breasted women! I think this needs no further clarification.  The music is excellent. The soundtrack features a lot of decent hard rock tracks(I'm not writing heavy metal, because of inane debates by metal-purists (mostly with ugly goatees) that these are not metal-songs. Thank god, No!)And there's the majestic score by the late Elmer Bernstein. That simply blows you away with it's beauty (Listen to the Den sequence when the queen flies on the dragonflies, how the trumpets and the lower brass are sequestered by two themes, one rising, on descending.)  So in a dull world where tedious monochromatic fantasy trilogies pass for a good time, Heavy Metal is the lost jewel, that fortunately is discovered every generation. So gather your friends, get some beers and pizza-bagels and watch this movie, you'll love it."
2,"What can I say?  Starts off fine and dandy, the usual story, a BRAVE STORY! Downtrodden hero got some family problems make him want to run and hide and make things better. Kid meets kid, second kid has some problems too and a way of making things better. Cue the fantasy world! Real world is tough, fantasy world is tough too but there you have a goal, a reason for being, people to help, quests to fulfill and dark demons to vanquish. Same old same old but done well enough.  BUT  What were they thinking with the end of this film? What message are they trying to give? Where were they coming from? I was left dumbfounded! My mental ability is not something I brag about so it's possible there are people other than the writers who have a clue about this finale.  On TV they showed people leaving the cinema crying after watching this, I think I know why!"
2,"It a fairly decent film,the script isn't that bad,and for being a TV film had some very atmospheric moments given the way it ends obviously they were aiming for a TV series but i really had to laugh when i read the trivia page ""a pilot for a series never made"" because whoever made this should be suing the makers of ""Lost"" big time.. There are so many comparisons between them that it list them all should take pages JJ Abrams Damon Lindelof and co should be shamed of themselves for so blatantly ripping off ""Danger Island"" without giving either the director Tommy Lee Wallace or the writer William Bleich any credit ...not even a little nod in their direction in any interviews.. Lost is the better show its written better and the cast is better but i just wish they had been a bit more honest about how they came up with the idea for Lost"
2,"Question Mark was extremely disturbing, depressing, and dark. it was also bitingly funny. How i loved it! every character was very dysfunctional.. but in a way that was so real that it brought me back to my own traumatic past experiences.. it took me places in my head that i don't often go and sometimes avoid going.. and for that i thank it muchly.  it shows family & lovers that don't even know each other. they don't share their deep secrets and for the most part don't even try. they claim to love the shells around them while holding fast to their own. they're completely alienated & disconnected. most of the time they aren't even conscious of it because it's so routine for how they live.  there were so many interesting themes... characters who desired something deeply, then regretted it once it was theirs... pathetic self-defeating behaviors... sex and the pursuit of it... trying to be 'real' vs. living behind a facade...  i also *loved* the music...Hideous Input, I think did most the songs? i can't say enough about it.. oh, so good! but definitely not for the faint-hearted.."
2,"This film has one of the most odd concepts I've ever seen. At one point, Quintus,(the hero)is so distraught over the loss of Helen, (the witch) that he tries to rent his soul to Satan. This proposition was so stultifying, it left me speechless. It also seemed to stump the devil as well."
2,"Let's start at the end. Direct discussion of the point of the whole story could hardly be a spoiler, since the final success or failure f this point is left for readers to discover, if they are still interested. If fact, if the film makers had made the point explicit at th very beginning, they would have made a much better movie. But to demonstrate how they have subverted the best interests of the film, here are three comments from three recent reviewers expressing confusion as to the identity of the woman at the core of the story: ""The virus they thought the girl might have was never explained. Beyond that it made her some kinda bomb, maybe... But wouldn't they be afraid of catching it?"" - dkpedigo.  ""What he does not know, but soon learns is the knowledge the girl may be a sleeper threat to him, his boss and to those who don't want the girl to live after she arrives in America."" - thinker1691.  ""According to the film, the Neolites needed Aurora intact so they could establish their religion by showing that one of their own had twin virgin births."" - bnvrohm.  I actually ran through the end of this film three times before I finally got it: A virus is devastating North America and Aurora is a test-tube baby genetically designed to produce a race of superhumans who can survive the virus (by healing very rapidly) and reproduce without sex (which has left Aurora a side-effect of intense empathy). Consequently, the battle between the two scientists who effectively designed her is one of control, neither of them wants her dead, no matter what else they feel for her or what other use they may have for her. The former point needs explaining which never occurs in the film, and the latter point is senselessly obscured by the intense violence of the last major gun battle. And the decision to make both points mysterious has led to a conclusion that is confusing and unsatisfying, both intellectually and emotionally. I won't tell you exactly what happens, that would spoil it; but I suggest that after you've seen it you'll wonder if you care.  That said, the film is not a total loss as cynical sci-fi action film. Diesal actually gives a good performance here. There are some exciting action set-pieces, the dramatic and satiric set-pieces are occasionally intriguing, and the world of Babylon AD may be unpleasant but it is fully realized, which is the first demand for any sci-fi film.  But there's no doubt the story needed much more thought and better control than we see here. This journey should be leading somewhere, but when we get there, we wonder why we bothered."
2,"Although the self-absorbed undergraduates with their pseudo-intellectual babble will sniff about how ""the masses"" won't be able to ""connect"" or ""appreciate"" this movie, the reasonably intelligent movie-renter will recognize this film for what it is: a piece of crap. First, it is a road movie that rips off Kerouac and thinks that somehow gives it legitimacy. Second, it invokes Kurt Cobain, another transparent attempt to pass this off as a Gen X film by linking it to the over-commercialized and overpraised rock star. And third, it is just plain BAD. Inexplicable and pointless flashbacks of the two main characters as kids (yeah, we get it, they are buddies) are one problem, but the real weakness is the constant ripoff of Tarantino - an annoying drug dealer who engages in a monologue that exists only to waste the viewer's time, thugs who chase the ""hero"" for screwing a gangster's wife, we've all variations of this before. I rented this because of Jake Gyllenhall, a fine actor (go see Brokeback Mountain and Donnie Darko if you don't believe me), but his character exists in a drug-addled haze to Leto's brain-dead pool boy, who isn't high and has no excuse for his imbecility. Jake must have needed the money (it is supposed to have a $14 million budget, but clearly not in the cinematography department), for this stinker does nothing to enhance his indie-movie icon status. For a much better movie from 2002 that showcases his acting ability, check out ""The Good Girl."""
2,"The Wraith starts late one night deep in the Arizona desert as what looks like several balls of electricity fly along just above the ground eventually they merge together & form a futuristic black car & a shadowy mysterious figure that is the wraith. Packard Walsh (Nick Cassavetes) is the leader of a local gang of thugs who terrorise a small town & force other drivers of particularly nice cars to race & forfeit their car if they lose, which of course they always do. Well they always did until the wraith & his supernatural powered turbo charged car turns up, each time one of Packard's gang races the wraith they end up dead starting with Oggie Fisher (Griffin O'Neal) whose car ends up taking a dive off a cliff, Loomis (Randy Quaid) the local Sheriff is on the case. If Packard's ever shrinking gang & the ensuing police investigation isn't enough for him to worry about a new kid in town named Jake Kesey (Charlie Sheen) seems to want to date his girl Keri Johnson (Sherilyn Fenn). As Packard loses grip on the power he has he becomes determined to take revenge on the wraith, however Packard isn't the only one with revenge on his mind...  Written & directed by Mike Marvin I really didn't think too much of The Wraith. Before I start I should point out that if you read the IMDb's 'main page' for The Wraith & look at the cast list it gives away the supposed twist at the end, not that you wouldn't have guessed it within 10 minutes anyway but the IMDb usually frowns upon spoilers doesn't it... The script is as daft as they come & it takes itself very seriously, people don't speak like this in real life Mike, OK? The terrible dialogue is delivered straight faced which just doesn't work when your making a film about a supernatural car. If you think The Wraith is a silly concept for a film you would be right, it's also a crap concept for a film. Nothing is explained, how was the wraith created? Why does he get a second chance & no one else? When a couple of dead bodies are recovered from burning cars why are the bodies intact & their eyes missing? This happens a few times during The Wraith & no explanation is given whatsoever & the plot device isn't even used, at all. Why doesn't the wraith just blow Packard away with the shotgun when he had the chance? Why is the only plot twist in the entire film so easy to see coming? What on Earth is Clint Howard's hair do all about?! Why are all the character's so dumb & one dimensional? Why does Charlie Sheen get top billing on the credits yet has about 10 minutes worth of screen time & all but disappears for 45 minutes (not that I'm complaining)? Why did they decide to end things off all 'happily ever after' with plenty of cringe inducing sentimentality in a way Disney would have have been proud of? To it's credit it sort of entertains in a bad grade z sort of way & it moves along at a fair pace so at least it's never overly boring or dull.  Director Marvin brings little imagination to the action scenes, two cars racing along a virtually deserted road starts to become tedious after the fourth time. He doesn't seem to know what sort of film he want's to make, action, horror, romance, comedy, Sci-Fi or thriller & ends up with bits of each that don't gel. The wraith himself looks like some sort of Stormtrooper reject from Star Wars (1977), a very cheap suit & crash helmet & he barely has any screen time either. Marvin tries to create some style with the use of bright neon colour although completely fails of course. Forget about any sort of violence as there isn't any worth mentioning but there is some nudity.  With a supposed budget of $2,700,000 The Wraith is technically good although nothing spectacular & they should have put more effort into how the wraith himself looked. The stunts are OK & there are some decent explosions but it's nothing we haven't seen a hundred time before & the tings we haven't seen before including a car which can magically reform itself are just plain daft & feel out of place. The photography is good, the rock music is highly annoying & adds nothing to the film but generally speaking it's quite well made. The acting isn't great & Clint Howard's hair deserves a credit all of it's own, Sheen & Cassavetes also have bad 80's hair-dos.  Personally I didn't think much of The Wraith although it's just about daft enough to have a certain charm & maybe have a few admirers. I will give it three out of ten stars for some OK explosions, the silliness of it all &, of course, Clint Howard's hair."
2,"This is one of those little gems you'll be lucky to find in a video store if you're on the lookout for such an item, or, like me, are likely to find on movie channels such as IFC or Sundance, which is where I saw it. Kate Beckinsale plays a young lady among a decidedly strange group of relatives on an obscure English country farm and, while ostensibly there to write her first novel, brings change to the lives of everyone involved. All the players are delightfully involved in their characters and all seem genuinely committed to this quirky little piece which is both lighthearted and eminently watchable. A young Kate Beckinsale is captivating in her loveliness and expressiveness which is totally controlled and shows her to be a born actress. Definitely one to capture on DVD!"
2,This light-hearted comedy is amongst other things a p*** take of all things Scottish and a chance for Mr Myers to show off his much used Scottish accent. While this could all have gone horribly wrong I genuinely love this film. It is wickedly funny in places but it is its overall warmness that makes it a success (unfortunately not at the box office anywhere near as much as it should have been). A real feel good movie.  Being Scottish I appreciate the films stance. Whilst mocking all those terrible tartan images which are so cringeworthy at the best of times it never takes it too far and it feels like it is an affectionate laugh at us and our 'culture' rather than an out and out pisstake. Besides Myers is genuinely funny whatever he does and well San Francisco's never looked better has it.  Charlie - light a
1,"Ho, ho, homicidal maniac! This spirited tour-de-force adaptation of a great EC Comics horror tale is undoubtedly one of the best episodes of the cable TV series ever made. Director Robert (""Back to the Future"") Zemeckis makes the most out of a witty script by Fred (""Night of the Creeps,"" ""The Monster Squad"") Dekker which centers on a ruthless two-timing housewife (well played by Mary Ellen Trainor, who was married to Zemeckis when she starred in this episode) who kills her jilted jerk of a husband (a nice cameo by Marshall Bell) on Christmas Eve by whacking him upside the head with a fire-poker. Complications ensue when a deranged murderous madman dressed up as jolly Kris Kringle escapes from a nearby asylum and decides to pay Trainor a decidedly unfriendly visit. Alan Silvestri's spooky, stirring score and Dean Cundey's typically polished cinematography further enhance the macabre fun. And Larry Drake (the sweet gentle giant Benny on ""L.A. Law""!), with his creepy hiccuping guffaw, a demented twinkle in his bright green eyes, and a leering, truly wicked grin, makes for a sensational sanguinary Saint Nick."
0,"the lowest score possible is one star? that's a shame. really, i'm going to lobby IMDb for a ""zero stars"" option. to give this film even a single star is giving WAY too much. am i the only one who noticed the microphones dangling over hopper's head at the station? and the acting, or should i say the lack thereof? apparently talent wasn't a factor when the casting director came to town. my little sister's elementary school talent show provides greater range and depth of emotion. and those fake irish accents were like nails on a chalk board. the only thing that could have made this movie worse would have been...oh, wait, no,no, it's already as bad as it can get."
2,"My baby sister was watching this movie, because she wants to be a ""baller"" like me. So i sat with her, and i was watching the movie. And i liked it even more, because i had meet up with the same type of girls when i was in the basketball team, and i also got my ankle injured because of the same reason, trying so hard to be in the front, but thats what happens when you get that attitude. I love this movie, its not only for kids, i know for a fact teenagers will love it as much as i did. I think this movie is EXCELLENT! I give it a 13 out of 10! The actors were very good to. And the Ending was the best to me! I though thats was so COOL! I don't want to spoil the ending, you have to watch this movie!"
2,"I wound up with this movie on one of those dubious £3.99 four-packs full of 'films you've never heard of'. And, well, on a slow Sunday, I treated myself to the experience...  And, frankly, I was more than pleasantly surprised. Snappy banter plus strong performance from the leads made up for a transparent plot and lackluster 'action' sequences.  Gangsters, reporters, dames in distress (and even a particularly dismal 'car chase scene') - all the traditional trappings of the 'noir' genre, but given a slightly humorous edge by Ayres' enjoyable performance as a wise-cracking reporter."
2,"This game is a fine example of how one is supposed to use the new media. The story really grabs you tight and the only thing you want is more.  Mankind is fighting a losing war for survival in a galactic war against the evil catlike race Kilrathi. The game begins at the carrier ""Tiger's Claw"" and evolves quickly to an engrossing story about humanity's finest hour.  I surely can recommend this game!"
2,"Perhaps you must be in the thirty something crowd to really appreciate the time and attention to detail it took for this film to convey the period and the attitude of the characters. It is so sullen and casual it reeks probability and reality. This is not an Oliver Stone idealistic 60's where EVERYONE is wearing bell bottoms and tie dye and driving around in red mustangs.   There is a distinctive generation gap between the parents and children in the movie. The father and mother still pay homage to the 50's and cling to to the ideal of raising a home when it is obvious the kids are already grown and moving on. There is a sense of transition and transformation strong for both parties and you feel the pivot turn.   The girls all each savor a little growing up, unique and personal to themselves while the parents become lost in failed expectation and guilt about the loss of a child years earlier."
2,"Much like the entrance of Laura in the film LAURA, Harry Lime's entrance into the dark world of post-war Vienna is one of the most unforgettable of all times and effectively erased any memory that Joseph Cotten, the main hero (and alter-ego of Graham Greene) was even in THE THIRD MAN. Photographed under an opening window in a deserted Vienna street, Lime comes into focus as a fleeting face with a smug expression and suddenly we remember Orson Welles was included in the credits. It's a very powerful moment -- one which has us, the viewer, shift our consciousness into wanting to see more of him, wanting to get to know him even if he is a shady, corrupted character. It's the One Moment in the film when it seems that time (in a country that makes clocks, something that Lime makes a joking reference to later on) stops dead in its tracks.  THE THIRD MAN is the one film-noir that doesn't have a treacherous femme fatale and the usual suspects but shady people and a growing sense of doom and despair. That in essence is the very nature of film-noir, where it began before demanding the appearance of a sexy blonde with evil intentions. A political theme and espionage reigns throughout without it ever being as much as hinted at, and betrayal is at every corner, something that Hitchcock would have loved had he directed this film. There is a distant echo of CASABLANCA reflected in the threesome at the center of this story with Anna being the reserved woman in the middle but this is not a lush romance. If anything, there is a strong anti-romantic sentiment here, not only because Anna has been irrevocably separated from Lime but she also will not be the one whom Cotten's Martins gets at the end. And in that sense, that pessimism is what film-noir is about."

2,"What the hell is this? Michael Anderson is a good director, and has done good films in the past, but this? A giant octopus - or is it a sea monster - attacks, and the crewmen WALKS into the mouth of it and thinks they gonna survive???  And what is it with Hollywood concerning the fact, that there CAN'T be a group of men living together on a tiny area, for a long time?? In all modern versions of Jules Verne books (except Richard Fleischers version), there are some characters replaced by female versions. Do Hollywood think that ALL men are gay???  Two versions came the same year and in BOTH the professor has a daughter...  Well, Ben Cross is brilliant - as always (and 2 points for that). Richard Crenna is OK, but the rest? No, let Nautilus go to the bottom and the let crew & passengers rest in peace..."
0,"Oh... my... god... this is without a doubt the absolute cheesiest movie I have ever seen. The acting is bad, the story is weak, the characters are weaker, and the whole film just doesn't make sense. Couple this with mediocre directing, really strange scenes (such as the one where the kid reaches over the ravine and mysteriously falls in), and thoroughly abysmal dialog (""Look!"" ""Musta peed his pants!""), and you get one complete failure. Not to mention the fact that the only thing Mr. Atlas looks like he could defeat is a case of chocolate bars. But this is part of the movie's charm. Sit down and watch it with a few of your friends for a good laugh.   I love this movie, because it's just SO BAD!"
0,"This is the type of movie where it actually hurts to acknowledge that it really, really sucks. I normally sanctify stuff like this! Early 70's grindhouse flicks with scrumptious sounding titles and a schlocky low-budget atmosphere usually ROCK. ""House of Seven Corpses"" appeared to dispose of even more trumps, since the cast is a gathering of great genre veterans (including John Carradine, John Ireland and Faith Domergue) and the filming locations (the titular house, the graveyard) are obviously very expedient for a gloomy tale of terror. The film opens with its absolute greatest and most hauntingly memorable sequences, though sadly enough they're the only ones that qualify as such. The credits are a splendid montage, complete with freakish color-effects and eerie freeze-frames, illustrating how the titular house received its notorious reputation. The last seven owners were mysteriously murdered here and the credits montage gleefully exhibits their final moments. Someone falls down the balcony screaming, a lady drowns in her bathtub, and another female body hangs dangling from the ceiling and four more macabre tableaux. Needless to say the house is cursed and the awkward behavior of t caretaker Mr. Price (Carradine) only fortify this reputation. In other words, the house forms the ideal turf for the acclaimed director Eric Hartman (John Ireland) to shoot his satanic horror film project. The film-within-film structure is what mainly causes ""House of Seven Corpses"" to be so boring and uneventful. A lot of movie-material is wasted on crew members putting films spools in the camera and dragging around cables or  even worse  Faith Domergue and Charles Macaulay portraying horridly intolerable actor stereotypes. The plot finally gets a little interesting (only a little, mind you) when one of the characters reads some lines from an occult book and accidentally awakes a rotting corpse in the backyard. The asthmatic (judging by the noises he produces) zombie slowly heads for the house and kills the entire movie crew, reminiscent of how the previous seven turned into corpses. After a running time of approximately 60 minutes, the film suddenly turns from humdrum into just plain weird and confusing. I'm still unsure whether the final twist has to do with the concept of reincarnation or just coincidence and all the remaining characters suddenly seem to go undergo vast mental transformations shortly before they die, for some reason. I honestly regret confirming ""House of Seven Corpses"" is a pretty dreadful movie. The locations and scenery are gloomy chilling, but not nearly used to full effect and there's a serious lack of gruesome bloodshed. Numerous low-budgeted 70's gems were stunningly gross, so the lack of financial means is no excuse and the film-within-film murders really don't count. Even the always-reliable veteran stars deliver hammy performances and Harrison's direction is completely uninspired. Not recommended, unless you think the zero cool four-and-a-half minute playing opening credits montage is worth the effort of purchasing a copy."
1,"A group of model-caliber San Francisco women who have been friends since elementary school are suddenly being threatened and attacked by someone sending them bizarre Valentine's Day cards. Who is the killer and why is the killer after them?   My rating will often change on subsequent viewings of a film--sometimes slightly up, sometimes slightly down. However, I can't remember another film where my rating has changed as drastically as it has for Valentine. The first time I watched it, upon its theatrical release, I thought it was pretty awful--I gave it a 4 out of 10, the equivalent of an ""F"" letter grade. Watching it for a second time last night, I can't remember what the heck I didn't like about it. I can only assume that maybe I was really in the wrong mood to watch it, or maybe I just didn't get it. In any event, I loved it this time, giving it a 9 out of 10, or an ""A"".  It might sound ridiculous saying I didn't get a film like this, but there is something to get. Valentine is almost a comedy/horror. Director Jamie Blanks, who was also responsible for 1998's Urban Legend, takes the stereotypical teen horror formula that became so popular in the late 1990s in the wake of Scream (1996) and pushes most of the elements up a notch, making Valentine intentionally cheesy/campy almost to the point of absurdity (where absurdism is a positive stylistic term). On top of that, he gives us a film imbued with humorous commentary on romantic relationships. The humor is unusual in that it has the same exaggeratedly campy tone as the teen horror aspects. Most of the situations in the film, and the modus operandi of the villain, humorous or not, are tied in to the Valentine's Day theme.  Many viewers will likely subtract points from the film for its various cliché-rooted but implausible scenarios and plot developments. However, in light of the above, the film is intentionally clichéd, implausible and ludicrous. It's as if Blanks is attempting (and mostly succeeding) to transcend the typical teen slasher by mocking/spoofing the conventions of the genre while also satirizing eros. That's the attraction to the irony of basing a horror film on Valentine's Day. It's an incongruity that is cleverly woven throughout the film, and that is itself at the heart of the slasher genre, making it prime fodder for Valentine's extravagant lampooning. Scream had a similar aim with its horror material, but the twist there was that the film was ""self-aware"". Valentine's Day is intentionally not self-aware; the viewer has to rely on contextual clues for satire. Lest some think I'm ""reading too much"" into the film, it's worthwhile to note that Blanks said in interviews that he ""didn't want to just do another slasher film after Urban Legend"" and producer Dylan Sellers said he wanted to do something ""more adult"".  Other viewers may dislike the fact that Valentine's Day differs so much from its putative source material, the novel of the same name by Tom Savage. The novel's characters, setting and plot are very different from the film. Sellers has said, ""While it was a fine book, I didn't think it was the right story for a film"". So instead the novel, which is much dryer and more serious in tone, was used as a launching pad, a motif to create variations on for a horror/thriller story centered on Valentine's Day. While those facts won't help purists familiar with the book like the film, it's helpful to understand why the film has its divergent plot and attitude. It's probably better to look at the film as an independent entity with a similar theme.  Blanks' direction is impeccable visually. Valentine's Day has a lush look throughout, with complex, deep colors, interesting sets, and good staging. Blanks is admirable for keeping his villain and attack scenes not too dark, with clearly conveyed action. He also directs his actors with aplomb, catalyzing often slyly humorous performances. David Boreanaz, as Adam Carr, is involved in many of the funniest moments.  While Valentine's Day is no masterpiece, it's a very good horror/thriller film that seems strongly prone to misconceptions. If you watch it expecting something more tongue-in-cheek you may find yourself appreciating it a lot more."
2,"Unfortunately for me, since I was feeling poorly already, I subjected my eyes and ears to this horrible waste of film.  To say that it was so bad that even monkeys would have brain damage after watching it is an understatement. Peter No one's teeth look like part of Stonehenge, and his acting is just as rock-like.  Holloway's talent was wasted here, and the useless frame after frame after frame after FRAME of the no talent Sarah Caldwell made it VERY clear that the dog had more talent.  Speaking of the dog, any movie that would have greyhound racing as the premise is bad enough, but with this dreck of a script, it astounds me that this movie was made at all. Not to mention this piece of dog poo(greyhound perhaps) of a 'film' gave birth to ""A kind of Hush"", which I am sure, if played for more than 6 hours to a plant, would make it curl up and die.  I loved the denouement, though. It occurred when the film in the camera ran out, apparently.  This film makes Spice World look like Citizen Kane. I weep for all the guitar picks that weren't made because the film was used on this horrible bit of pig vomit.  It was.............bad."
2,"Working as an Alpine hotel maid, a SWISS MISS prima donna tries to capture her composer husband's attention - with a little help from Stan Laurel & Oliver Hardy.  Although given good production values by the Hal Roach Studios, Stan & Ollie are the only real reason to watch this minor comedy. While on screen, they never fail to amuse and entertain. (Watch Laurel try to steal brandy from a sturdy St. Bernard - and Hardy sing `Let Me Call You Sweetheart,' accompanied by Stan on a tuba.) The trouble arises from the long stretches when they are missing, while the romantic subplot threatens to swamp the boat. Why couldn't Mr. Roach understand that the Boys' fans wanted to see the Boys, not a pair of vacuous lovers work out their marital difficulties?   Walter Woolf King & Della Lind are in good voice as the composer & his wife, and their songs are pleasant, if unremarkable. But we care not a whit for them, and regret every moment they filch from L & H. Even the usually humorous Eric Blore, as the composer's manager, has to deliver lines that are rather forced & flat.  But the Boys come through hilariously with what time they are allotted. Whether trying to sell mousetraps to suspicious Swiss, or attempting to move a heavy piano across a most vertiginous swinging bridge (while being hampered by a gorilla), they are never anything less than magnificent - the sweetly innocent visitors from a zany parallel universe all their own."
2,"I watched Two-Lane Blacktop last night for the first time and all I can say is ""Wow"". While I may not be one of those who proclaims it to be the greatest movie ever filmed, it is certainly a fine piece of American cinema. I'm not sure I've ever seen a film quite like it. That's because there aren't many directors out there like Monte Hellman with the guts or patience to make something like Two-Lane Blacktop. For starters, the cast includes non-actors in three of the four main roles. I think all do a wonderful job and their lack of experience (James Taylor being the best example) actually worked in the movie's favor. The fourth actor, Warren Oates, gives another amazing performance.   Next, Hellman made a 102 minute movie that has about 15 minutes of dialogue. But you know what, it doesn't need any more. Taylor as The Driver and Dennis Wilson as The Mechanic don't need to talk. Their car does all the talking for them. And when they do talk (except for a rare, poignant moment near the end of the film when The Driver shows a hint of humanity), their conversations revolve around carburetors and such. Anyway, Oates' character, GTO, does enough talking for everyone.   Hellman also made a movie with so little action (other than a few race scenes) that some people look at it and see nothing. I don't know how many comments I've read that call Two-Lane Blacktop ""boring"" or ""dull"". I see a lot going on in the movie but I think it's either too subtle for some people or they don't have the patience to just go along with it. The movie can most likely be interpreted a number of ways, but to me Two-Lane Blacktop is the story of four people on a journey. For The Driver and The Mechanic, they may have found what they're looking for in their car. The thrill of the next race and the challenge of the next tune-up are all that matters to them. As for GTO, he's looking for his life. He spins wild tales hoping one will stick. And The Girl is looking for someone to take care of her. The Driver, The Mechanic, and GTO are nice enough, but all are so into their own reality that they are incapable of giving The Girl what she needs.   Finally, I've read all the charges that Two-Lane Blacktop has no ending. I'll argue that it ends the only way it could. Just because the movie's over, it doesn't mean that any of the four characters have finished their quests. They started the movie looking for something and they end it the same way.   I'll stop there. I just hope my ramblings aren't quite as incoherent as they seem. In the end, I can easily see why this movie's not for everyone, but for me, Two-Lane Blacktop works  and works well. It's an amazing experience that I'm glad I finally had . For what it's worth, I'll give it a 8/10. That rating will most likely go up after a repeat viewing now that I know what to expect."
2,"The movie starts out in good speed but slows down after a while. But only for a short period of time for it becomes one of the best dramas ever. Sean Penn is excelent as a retarded father and the way he tries and tries to get his daughter back..... My girl cried like a baby. Awesome movie, go see it."
2,"""Un Crabe dans la tete"" focuses on Alex, a handsome but selfish underwater photographer who undergoes a number of emotional, life-changing experiences while passing through Montreal. When all is said and done, however, writer/director Andre Turpin has presented little more than a rudderless narrative featuring a bunch of unlikable and uninteresting characters, characters whose patience for the boorish protagonist is nearly unaccountable.  Again and again, one finds oneself mystified by Alex's actions: If he's meant to be a selfish man, only out for himself and afraid of commitment--leaving his wife after the wedding without a word--why, on the other hand, is he so dangerously loyal to a pathetic female drug dealer? If he can thoughtlessly fall into the arms of his best friend's vulnerable lover, how can he suddenly be so completely (almost overly) ethical about a series of disturbing photographs his agent wants him to display? Great films have been made by examining ""unlikable"" or selfish characters and about people whose actions and motivations are almost inexplicable (i.e. John Cassavetties' films), but the confusion of this film's characters is never thematized or explored. Alex acts the way he acts only so the melodrama can take another ""surprising"" turn.  The film is sharply, if erratically, shot, but most paying audiences will surely lose patience with Alex and his associates long before the film has ended."
2,"JAANEMANN.... 1 Leave your mind at home when you go to watch this film 2 direction is great in the beginning (as it apes musicals such as Chicago and moulin rouge) but fails miserably towards the end 3 Screenplay starts off well, then falls apart. 4 script is weak, dialogues are weaker. 5 acting is standard though nothing great - akshay has a gr8 character though salman's is the meatier role. priety could have done the role in her sleep, nothing new for her. aman vermas character and relation was left undefined for a long time- bad role, well acted. 6 the music is tuneful and enjoyable. but would have been better just as instrumental 7 Lyrics are PATHETIC (lyrics would have been better if they were written by a nursery school child) 8 editing was surprisingly patchy in parts. odd, as the film's director used to be an editor  trivia: a character is named preity zintakova. aman verma's characters name is zubin HORNIBOI (hahahah)  best: Akshay's Laughter. THE CUTE KID worst: SALMAN'S COSTUMES!! The annoying kids and family members towards the end!"
2,"Perhaps first time director Russell DeGrazier will turn into something one day, but it's not going to be on the basis of this movie. Decent actors, but overall an uninvolving script with characters that I didn't care a fig about. The abrupt ending is blessed relief from the boredom."
2,"This movie must have Ben written by someone with absolutely no exposure to the military. If your big on bashing the military or you think everyone who serves is a drug addicted scam-mer or a high ranking moron, you will probably enjoy this movie. If you have any grasp of reality you will hate it. Buffalo Soldiers is the kind of movie that reminds you that actors are not in general very intelligent.  I actually like Ed Harris and Joaquin Phoenix,but how on earth could they lower themselves to make this a piece of crap is beyond me.  I can't help but wonder how movies like this get made. You have to at some point realize that what you are making is absolute rubbish."
0,"CQ could have been good, campy fun. But it commits the only unforgivable sin: it is b-o-r-i-n-g! The pace is deadly slow and the plot is fairly confused and so artificial that it's next to impossible to care where it's going. The story would have been acceptable in a creative writing class from a thoughtful and sensitive eighth grader but this video should have carried a warning label: ""CAUTION: Student film. Fit for viewing only by relatives of the film maker."""
1,"A true wholesome American story about teenagers who are interested in launching their own rocket in a rural West Virginia coal mining town, after the launch of Sputnik in 1957.  Through trial, tribulations and perseverance beyond belief, they are ultimately able to achieve their goals.  Jake Gyllenhaal, as the leader of the group, is excellent in the title role. As his motivating science teacher, Laura Linney is quite good but her southern accent is over the top.  There is a standout supporting performance by Chris Cooper, a head miner, who wants his son to follow in his footsteps, but gradually comes around at film's end.  What makes this film so unusual for our times is that there are no bed-hopping scenes and no profanity whatsoever. It is the epitome of an American story that is well done.  Besides the science angle, we have the father-son disagreement, football scholarships as a way to escape coal mining, and the loving spirit of family.  Why aren't pictures like this recognized more at award times?"
2,"The things that had me on the edge of my seat during Brokeback Mountain was the amazing cinematography and the thrilling music. I just wanted to get as close as possible to the screen.  Those two things were not as impressive in Soleil Rouge, but they were good enough that Oscar nominee Henri Alekan's (Roman Holiday, Wings of Desire) cinematography and three-time Oscar winner Maurice Jarre's (A Passage to India, Doctor Zhivago, Lawrence of Arabia) music make this film worth watching all by itself.  Directed by Terence Young (Dr. No, From Russia With Love), the film stars one of my favorites, Charles Bronson (Mr. Majestyk , Once Upon a Time in the West, Death Wish 1-5) and Japan's greatest actor, Toshirô Mifune. If that is not enough, it also starred Golden Globe winner Ursula Andress (Dr. No) and Alain Delon (Le Samouraï, The Leopard).  Now, how in the world do you get Mifune in the old west, dressed as a Samurai, no less. He is accompanying the Japanese Ambassador on a train that is robbed by Bronson and Delon. A sword destined to be given to the President is stolen and he must serve his mater and retrieve it. Bronson is double-crossed by Delon and left for dead. Mifune and Bronson join together in a strange journey to retrieve the sword and Bronson's loot.  Mifune is classic Samurai, and Bronson is the funniest I have seen him in the many films I have watched. he has that magic that made Mr. Majestic so fun to watch.  Along the way, they stop in a whorehouse and pick up Andress as a hostage. She is Delon's girlfriend. She gives us a good view of her hootage as she changes a shirt while waiting with Bronson. Spanish actress Mónica Randall also gave us a skintastic display when in bed with Mifune.  Lots of western action with shootouts between Bronson and the bay guys, and the whole gang against the Comanches. Mifune uses his sword to good effect as he adds the expected bright red to the screen.  Eastern philosophy meets Western crudity in a classic."
2,"Doc Hollywood is one of my most favorite films that I don't mind watching over and over. Perhaps it is because it is so well written, has outstanding actors, or that I recognize the realistic characters and one street Southern town it is based on, Micanopy, FL, having lived in nearby Gainesville. Michael J. Fox has never made a bad movie and I've always admired his enthusiastic characters. Julie Warner is a good match for him in looks and talent. I can't believe she isn't a bigger star by now. Merrill Streep and Rene Zellwigger have nothing on her and she is far better looking than either. They must have better agents. Julie's recent recurring character in Nip Tuck gave an Emmy Award performance every week and stands out even in that cast of stand out actors. Doc Hollywood has a similarly talented cast with great dialog and excellent direction. The result is one of those rare Chick Flicks, like Groundhogs Day, that guys don't mind watching, even without a chick. If I had to be stuck on an island with only a handful of DVD movies to watch over and over, this would be one I'd choose. In a rush I'd also grab the Back to the Future trilogy and half a dozen of Arnold's classics."
1,"I would have given this otherwise terrific series a full 10 vote if Claudia Black had not continued on in it! Her inclusion as the silly 'Vela' has brought the series down in my estimation. To bring her in as a regular at the same time as including Ben Browder to replace RDA was a mistake.  Unfortunately we were just reeling from the loss of 'Jack' and really didn't need this great series turned into new episodes of 'Farscape'.  I was a great fan of the film ""Stargate"" and when the series was first announced I had reservations that it could live up to the film, but after watching the first episode I have to admit I was hooked. I have always looked forward to new episodes with great anticipation"
1,"This is a unique and bold film. It's energetic, with highly developed characters. Very good performances.   I love directors who are not afraid to ask the audience to think...   Bret Carr dares to look inward, ask questions, and dig underneath the surface. By the nature of the film, it practically demands that the viewer look inward as well. It can take some courage to do this. I can see how some close-minded people might find this quite disturbing. However, I found it thought-provoking, much more than just entertainment.  Bret Carr is truly an original filmmaker, with vision. I am curious to see what he will do next.  Watch him."
2,"My parents had rented this show because they heard it was good, and there was nothing on T.V., so I decided to watch it with them. And oh my gosh, I couldn't stop watching! It was so good. I needed to know what happened next every single episode, so now, I'm addicted. It's like a roller coaster: it has many twists and turns, you never know what'll happen next, thrilling, exiting, and fun.  The story is supposed to be in real time. Each episode is 1 hour, each season has 24 episodes, so one season is supposed to be 1 day. What happens is Jack Bauer, who works for CTU, finds out that his daughter had been kidnapped. He'll do anything to save her, and, well, you'll see what happens. (This is the plot for season 1)  Trust me, you won't be able to take your eyes off of the screen."
2,"Frankenstein 1970 starts deep in some German woods with Carolyn Hayes (Jana Lund) desperately running from a monster intent on killing her... Film director Douglas Row (Don 'Red' Barry) shouts cut & the scene is in the can. Baron Victor von Frankenstein (Boris Karloff) has hit hard times & is skint, he has let a film-crew consisting of Row, cameraman Morgan Haley (John Dennis), writer Judy Stevens (Charlotte Austin), assistant director Mike Shaw (Tom Duggan) & actress Hayes make a film in & around his castle & estates about his ancestor's. As one would expect the current, & last, Frankenstein is continuing the family tradition of trying to re-animate a stitched together body (Mike Lane). His latest patchwork creation is missing several vital ingredient's, a heart, a brain, a face & a couple of eye's. His nosey servant Shuter (Norbert Schiller) provides the brain & heart, however while handling the eye's Frankenstein drops them. He re-animates his monster so it can go & find a suitable pair, meanwhile all the missing people are starting to make everyone become suspicious of Frankenstein & what his real intentions are...  This black and white potboiler was directed by Howard W. Koch & there is very little to recommend in Frankenstein 1970, & that's another thing what's with the 1970 in the title? No mention of the fact it is set in the year 1970 is made & the film was made in 1958. Anyway, I am amazed that the script by Richard H. Landau, Charles A. Moses, Aubrey Schenck & George Worthing Yates took four people to write it. Four people?! Didn't at least one of them stand up & say 'look guys this is total crap & the audience deserves better', obviously not it would appear. It's slow, boring, uneventful & is basically Frankenstein trying to create a monster using spare parts from various unwilling donors just like most other cheap Frankenstein films. He doesn't even get an assistant this time. The only original part of Frankenstein 1970 is the presence of the film-crew but it's never used to forward the story or try to take things in a different direction other than one would expect. The ending is abrupt but there is a certain degree of fun to be had watching this man with a bucket on his head wrapped in bandages running around trying to act scary & menacing, totally failing of course.  Director Koch does nothing to distinguish the film & it's bland throughout from the awfully dated lab to the flat castle interiors. The lab itself features some of the worst looking scientific equipment ever, massive computer panels with huge dials & knobs to all the stupid flashing lights & a control panel that wobbles whenever Frankenstein touches it. The monster starts off looking OK as it lies on an bed with no skin on it's face & just it's skull exposed but once it gets re-animated it looks awful, it's completely wrapped from head to toe in bandages (which makes it look more like a Mummy) & the shape & size of it's head resembles a large bucket! One more thing, when the monster is looking for some eye's for itself how can it see where it's going or who it's kidnapping & why are there eye holes cut into the bandage's around the bucket, erm sorry head, so it can 'see'?  With a budget of about $110,000 Frankenstein 1970 looks cheap throughout & considering Hammer's Curse of Frankenstein (1957) looked better & was made a year previous there really is no excuse, it's just bad film-making. The acting is poor & Karloff is obviously living on past glories here, in this he has a weird haircut, a stupid exaggerated limp & scar on his face.  There really is very little to recommend Frankenstein 1970 by, I can't really think of anything other than the fact that I have seen worse films. Not one of Karloff's finer moments although I'm sure fans of his will lap it up. Not worth bothering with."
2,"Simply put: Alias is a hype job.  It pretends to be a lot of things that it's not.  First of all, it pretend to be that intelligent, complicated spy thriller. Of course, to be ""intelligent"" requires something other than ridiculous situations and plot holes galore. I know, that's exactly what 24 does... but 24 picked up the hype where Alias left it and is no more intelligent than Alias.  J.J. Abrams is really good at hyping himself, and unfortunately in today's Hollywood environment where TV executives are only worried about appearing hip and edgy, that's all that's required. Actual quality in J.J. Abrams' writing? There is none.  Then there is Jennifer Garner. A decent but not stellar actress in other projects, she gives some of her worst performances in alias. Why? Because all she does is pout and mug for the camera. Understandable. After all J.J. Abrams thinks of Alias as a fashion show and knows the only thing that'll keep them tuning in is to show Jennifer in various states of undress and funky costumes.  Look no further than the main titles to see that's all Alias was about: a fashion show."
2,"That sums up the whole movie. The movie is clearly made just to entertain few friends. The plot is absolutely stupid, ""acting"" is simply terrible and the dialog sounds like it had been improvised during shooting. The special-fx though are pretty good for a no-budget film like this. There's few pretty good jokes like the occult library of a mad scientist which includes necronomicon, and kama-sutra. The use of Finnish V-word (equivalent for English F-word) gets to your nerves. I mean it's said about 200 times and enough is enough. If you like very bad movies this one's for you. The DVD release includes lots of extras, like the short movie ""El' Pok Erimas Sacre"" which is actually much better than Frankenström."
2,"""12 angry men"" was really a disappointment for a guy like me who waited for 1 hour to watch a story in the film...but after an hour i have realized that how wrong i was to download such a film..i was so much desperate to watch dis flick and in the end it disappointed very much.  I've heard people saying it is a simple story though i din' found it simple rather i found it irritating. There was no reason for making such movie and moreover no reason to share a place in top 10 list.  I can not see even a single positive point about the film except few dialogues..few dialogues were excellent..henry fonda was average but unfortunately sidney lumet nowhere shows the direction which i was expecting from such a good director.  just 12 jurors fighting on a murder and the life of the kid was in their hands. 11 were in the favor of GUILTY for the kid, while one was saying the kid on whom the blame was to kill his father was NOT GUILTY and after more than 1 hour of distracting and boring discussion the alone juror who feels the kid was not guilty was successful in changing the mind of other 11 jurors and in the end saved the life of the kid.  Watch it on your on sake.. 3.9/10"
2,"A young man whose specialty lies in marketing takes over his dead father's ailing shoe-making factory, turning the product away from mens-wear into a boot business for drag queens. Is it possible to build a feel-good comedy on the ultimate fortunes of a sad sack from Britain's Northampton district who can't tell an evil, nasty girl (his fiancée) from an honest, hard-working one with an open mind? In this slimly-plotted British film directed by Julian Jarrold, the working-class are automatic bigots, women who strive for a life outside of the factories are bitches, and the enemy is someone with a closed mind (who has to be faced down on his turf in order to become enlightened). Though based on a real account, ""Kinky Boots"" is a tried-and-untrue stomp down familiar avenues. Joel Edgerton, who resembles Conan O'Brien, is serviceable as the new businessman until it's discovered that he too has issues with cross-dressers; putting an entire fashion show in Milan on the line, he turns on his friend and designer (Chiwetel Ejiofor) out of embarrassment. This is the kind of movie where people stare in shocked silence at other people ""they don't understand"", but the rejection here seems rooted in something more personal, less abstract--it's so disheartening that whatever triumphs follow ring false (some apologies come too late to matter). The happy-endings, which are then tacked on, have no exhilaration, no juicy kick. It's all shallow Hollywood--UK style. *1/2 from ****"
2,"First let me say I'm sorry for your pain and suffering if you have already seen this movie. The movie is no more than a poor at best attempt of an ongoing subject, Mummies and their curse. I'm still trying to figure out where the title ""7 Mummies"" comes from. Unless I missed something, which is possible since I had no problem going to the fridge without pausing this waste of time, I only counted 2 mummies. If the movie itself wasn't enough to make you cringe, the soundtrack will at the very least will give you a ""headbanging headache"".The bottom line is that if it weren't for Cerina Vincent and the ""Vamp Tramps"",it wouldn't have even gotten a 3! The best part of this movie other than looking Ms Vincent was the fact that it is only 80 minutes long. Good thing, I don't think I could have taken much more."
2,"This is really a 3rd rate, made-for-television mess. First of all, there is NO 'Laughter on the 23rd Floor' or any other floor - and for a Neil Simon play that is shameful. Nathan Lane is, Nathan Lane, a short loud mouthed Jackie Gleason sounding caricature of Sid Caesar during Sid's Show of Shows era. It's supposed to be manic and inspired, but it's just loud and pointless. All the reviews here seem to imply that a great cast of fine character actors stood behind Lane and help boost the show along  I don't buy that at all. None of the assorted 'fine character' actors helped anything, all their words and actions are forced to the point of being painful, their lines were very poorly delivered and none of them were believable for even one second  for which I blame director Richard Benjamin. An almost insulting attempt at adding substance to this train wreck is the tossing in of Edward R. Morrow's legendary Joe McCarthy Show underneath and in between the overacting of Lane's lemming running toward the sea character. Then it's all tossed aside for a nice tidy and gutless ending  My mother could write better than this. The one, single redeeming element in this claptrap is the very deftly played character of Lane's brother (Harry Price) played by character actor Richard Portnow. None of the other reviews even mention this guy but his is the ONLY performance worth a plug nickel in the whole show - everybody is running around frantically overacting their asses off to keep up with Lane and this guy steals the whole film out from underneath them with a quiet nod and a sheepish grin. If for some reason you feel compelled to waste your time watching this  Don't take your eyes of off Portnow, he is the ONLY reason to sit through it!"
